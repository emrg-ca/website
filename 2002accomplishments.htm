<h1>Accomplishments For 2002</h1>

<ul>

<li>Participated in both local Amateur Hamfests
<br/>The Ottawa Amateur Radio Club (OARC) and the Ottawa Valley Mobile Radio Club (OVMRC)
provide a prime location free of charge at their flea market/hamfest.</li>

<li>Participated in Emergency Preparedness Week Display
<br/>Sponsored by OCIPEP and City of Ottawa. Check out the pictures from the
<a href="epd_2002_05_06.htm">EMRG booth</a>.</li>

<li>Participated in Airport Exercise

Ottawa Airport staged a major exercise, integrated with City of Ottawa
agencies, including Police, Fire, EMS, People Services, Red Cross, Hospitals,
OC Transpo and EMRG. </li>

<li>Agreement for access to surplus radio equipment and radio sites
The City of Ottawa, Emergency Measures Unit and Fire Dept have been working
with EMRG on a solution to make radio equipment, repeaters and antenna
sites available to EMRG. This equipment is becoming available as the City
of Ottawa, specifically Ottawa Fire, migrate to the EDACS trunked radio
system.</li>

<li>First year for membership list yearly cleanup
Accurate contact information is critical for EMRG, but this involves more
than just adding names to a list and updating it when someone provides
new information. There must be a way to remove names from the list when
people move or are no longer interested. This process is now in place and
there is someone managing it.</li>

<li>3 general meetings, each with a training session
<br/>The main objective for 2002 was consistency, which meant a steady pace
all year long, that was still going strong at the end of the year. Each
of the general&nbsp; meetings included a short administration section followed
by a training session on communications.</li>

<li>Participated in Hospital Disaster Planning Conference
<br/>The Hospital Disaster Planning Committee in Ottawa sponsors and annual
conference. EMRG is a member of the planning committee and had an opportunity
to set up a display booth to talk about Amateur radio as a resource to
Hospitals and other agencies in an emergency.</li>

<li>Established and distributed standard DC power connector
<br/>EMRG, in partnership with the City of Ottawa Emergency Measures Unit, selected
a standard DC power connector to put on all equipment operated by EMRG.
The City provided the initial stock of connectors, which have been installed
on all radios in the EOC, Red Cross and are being installed on all spare
equipment. Each EMRG member received a free connector to build an adapter
to their equipment. Additional connectors are being sold to local Amateurs,
which provided the funding to replenish the connector supply. Here is a
picture of the <a href="anderson_powerpole.htm">standard connector</a>.</li>

<li>Establish VHF repeater (146.880-) at Fire Dispatch
<br/>EMRG has been re-assigned the VHF repeater frequency 146.880 MHz. This
is now used in an operational repeater, located at the consolidated fire
dispatch centre. The repeater antenna is on the tower and provides coverage
through a large part of the City and even beyond the City to the East.
This is part of the ongoing support from the City and Ottawa Fire.</li>

<li>Establish basic 144, 220, 440 radios at Fire Dispatch

<br/>Ottawa Fire has included EMRG as part of their consolidated communications
centre. EMRG has a room at the dispatch centre, for establishing Amateur
radio communications. The first step is complete, which includes the capability
to operate radios on three amateur bands. The development of the EMRG communications
centre will continue as resources are made available, once Ottawa Fire
moves to the trunked radio system.</li>
