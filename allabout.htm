<h1>The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Amateur radio is known around the world for its role in providing
communications in times of disaster. In order to provide effective
communications, Amateur radio operators must be prepared
and trained to be able to provide that high level of service.
</p>

<p>In Ottawa, the Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) is the local
Amateur radio emergency communications group. EMRG is not a club, is
not incorporated, and does not collect any dues. EMRG is a volunteer
organization that acts as the
interface between the Amateur radio community and organizations who need Amateur radio
communications in an Emergency or Disaster. EMRG has partnerships
with the City of Ottawa, Ottawa Red Cross and the Hospitals, to provide
communications if required in an emergency or disaster. Our partners
would use EMRG to contact local
radio operators for assistance in an emergency.
</p>

<p>EMRG is part of the RAC Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES)
program. ARES provides a common structure, which can be used to promote ARES
Federally and Provincially, as well as providing guidance to help new
groups get started. EMRG is also called
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ottawa ARES</span>,
two names, one group, one purpose.
</p>

<p>There are no special requirements to participate in EMRG, other than an
interest to help and a valid Amateur radio license. One of the purposes
of EMRG is to provide training and an opportunity for Amateurs to share
information, so new amateurs can participate effectively alongside long
time operators.
</p>

<p>Each EMRG member brings the equipment they can share in an
emergency.
However some sites have permanent equipment installed and EMRG is
building a small supply of radios, so even Amateurs with a license but
no equipment can still play an important role.
</p>

<p>It takes more than a group of individuals who own radios to be useful in an emergency. It
takes an organized team. Like any team activity, practice ensures that
everyone is playing the game together and is working from the same game
plan. Knowing whom to call, who is in charge, where to go, what to take
and which frequency to use, are some of the reasons why it is important to
prepare before a disaster strikes.
</p>

<h2>EMRG Interfaces In The Community</h2>

</p>

<p>EMRG provides a single point of contact to access the volunteer
radio operators in Ottawa, as well as interfacing with neighbouring radio
groups. The diagram shows the relationships that
exist in Ottawa. EMRG has direct relationships with the Ottawa Red
Cross and the Hospitals, as well as through the City of Ottawa Office
of Emergency Management.
</p>

<p>Communications for local events such as walk-a-thons, ski
races, soccer tournaments, etc, is often provided by the local
amateurs,
typically through one of the amateur radio clubs. EMRG is typically not
involved
in these events directly because most clubs have a history of working
with specific events and the clubs draw from the same pool of local
amateurs to provide the communications. Many
EMRG members participate in these events, which is encouraged by EMRG
because it is an excellent learning opportunity.
</p>

<p>In 2007, EMRG provided communications for the Tour Nortel. This is
an important addition for EMRG, because public service communications
provides an excellent training opportunity for amateur radio operators
to perfect operational skills and develop equipment improvements.
</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Liase between volunteer radio operators and emergency/disaster
	  planners within the City of Ottawa, the hospitals in Ottawa and the
      Ottawa branch of the Red Cross.</li>
  <li>Train radio operators with an interest in emergency
	  communications.</li>
  <li>Coordinate with emergency radio groups in other areas, before and
	  during an emergency.</li>
  <li>Test emergency facilities and procedures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>History of EMRG</h2>

<p>The role of volunteer radio communications in Ottawa, began back in
the 1950s and early 60s. EMO was set up at the national, provincial
and municipal levels. Equipment was put in place for emergency use, to
link agencies within a municipality and to link municipalities.
</p>

<p>In 1963 the XM49 Emergency Radio Squadron (XM49ers) was enlisted by
the local EMO coordinator for the Regional Municipality of
Ottawa-Carleton, as a way to expand the base of radio operators in the event of an
emergency. EMO provided courses in First Aid and CPR as well as training
exercises. In 1966 the XM49ers assisted during the Heron Road bridge collapse.
</p>

<p>The XM49ers were using General Radio Service (GRS) communications,
often referred to as CB. In 1980, amateur radio VHF repeaters were
available in Ottawa and a group was formed called the Emergency Measures Amateur Radio Group (EMARG).
This expanded the base of radio operators in the Region and provided
communications using repeaters.
</p>

<p>In 1990, the present organization, the Emergency Measures Radio
Group (EMRG) was formed.&nbsp;Today, all EMRG members have an Amateur radio license.
</p>

<h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>

<h3>Radio Communicators</h3>

<p>EMRG members are volunteer communications providers, not interpreters,
evaluators, or field commanders. The two main roles of members are:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>At fixed locations, transmit messages which have been given to
	  them by partner agency representatives, or to facilitate the partner
	  agency representatives talking directly over the radio if required.</li>
  <li>To work with or shadow field personnel to provide radio
	  communications back to a central area. In some cases, the radio
	  operator may also be the field person.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Secondary Communications</h3>

<p>Assisting the humanitarian response effort is the Primary Role for
amateur radio in an emergency or disaster. Amateur radio communications
is critical for organizations such as Community Services, the Red Cross
and the Salvation Army, who do not have an alternative to wired or
wireless telephones. Amateur radio can provide multiple communications
networks linking organizations together, using base, mobile and
portable radios.
</p>

<p>EMRGs role is to establish a secondary communications infrastructure which will;
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provide communications for agencies, field workers or local
	  citizen patrols, who do not have any radio communications capability</li>
  <li>Link various agencies which operate on different networks such as
	  Social Services, Hospitals &amp; the Red Cross</li>
  <li>Communicate with areas which have lost normal communications
	  networks such as telephone</li>
  <li>Link sites which do not normally require communications, such as
	  emergency shelters</li>
  <li>Assist in the event that primary communications systems are
	  degraded or disabled by the emergency or disaster</li>
</ul>

<p>Providing communications from a disaster site, within the City of
Ottawa or within the Province to support emergency management is not a
mandate for EMRG (Ottawa ARES). It is possible that EMRG (Ottawa
ARES) could be used to provide radio capacity for logistics support to
relieve pressure on other systems.
</p>

<p>Providing backup communications for Public Safety radio systems is NOT
a mandate for EMRG (Ottawa ARES). If the City of Ottawa radio system
used by Police and Fire failed, or if the Provincial radio system used
by Paramedics failed, EMRG (Ottawa ARES) would assist as much as
possible. It must be understood that there are not sufficient Amateur
radios, radio operators, or radio infrastructure (repeaters) to support
more than a few key sites, which is significantly less than the several
thousand radios they normally use. This is why commercial radio systems
used for Public Safety, cost so much. They are built with redundancy
and extra capacity for Emergencies and Disasters.
</p>

<h2>EMRG Operations</h2>

<h3>Areas of Operation</h3>

<p>EMRG stations would operate from outside the emergency core
(inner perimeter) of a disaster site. The inner core would be limited
to primary response agencies such as fire, police and ambulance. It is
also unlikely that Amateur radio would operate at the outside edge of
the disaster site, unless a specific communications capability is
requested. There may be certain secondary organizations
that are at the disaster perimeter, supporting first responders, who
may require communications. One example may be the Salvation Army
providing food services. In the event that Amateur radio is required,
the radio operators would typically be operating from the facilities
they are supporting, rather than a separate Amateur radio
communications post.
</p>

<h3>Emergency Plans</h3>

<p>The City Of Ottawa Emergency Plan identifies EMRG as a
communications resource and outlines the high level responsibilities
for EMRG. The EMRG plans provide the details of how EMRG will operate
to provide the required emergency communications.
</p>

<h3>Resources and Capabilities</h3>

<h4>Member Capabilities</h4>

<p>Members of EMRG provide three key items in an Emergency:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Skilled radio operators. They know how to use the radio!</li>
  <li>Radio Equipment. Members already have the radios!</li>
  <li>Transportation. Most members have vehicles for transportation and many vehicles are equipped with mobile radios.</li>
</ol>

<p>EMRG has some members who hold a valid Restricted Operators
Certificate (ROC) and an Amateur Radio license. The ROC provides licensed operation
of commercial Land mobile, Air and Marine radios.
This provides a resource of trained and licensed radio operators who
can operate commercial radio equipment if required.
</p>

<p>Many amateurs are involved in electronics or communications
personally
and/or professionally, providing tools and expertise, which can prove
very useful in an emergency.
</p>

<p>Amateur radio has an extensive network of voice repeaters, digital
repeaters (computer communications via radio), and individual
members with base, mobile and portable equipment, capable of local,
regional,
national and global communications.
</p>

<h3>Radio Network</h3>

<p>One major advantage of Amateur radio is the many frequencies
available for use. These frequencies are assigned in bands of
frequencies rather than as individual channels. These frequency bands
have different advantages such as local communications using VHF and
UHF or long distance using HF. EMRGs local communications is based on VHF
and UHF radios, similar to those used by commercial services.
</p>

<p>To improve coverage, amateur radio repeater sites with fixed
frequencies are used. It is also possible to operate without the
repeaters, which is important in an emergency where repeaters have
failed. Amateur radio operators have experience communicating without
repeaters using specialized antennas.
</p>

<p>When establishing an emergency
communications network, EMRG can establish multiple local communication
networks, each with their own frequency. These
local networks can be linked together through a wide area
communications network on still another band or frequency.
</p>

<h3>Mutual Aid</h3>

<p>In a sustained emergency, EMRG would not be able to provide sufficient
resources to operate 24 hours a day for an extended period of time.
Depending on the emergency, local Amateurs may be part of the
population impacted. In the event that additional resources are
required, EMRG has a Mutual Aid agreement with neighbouring ARES groups
and meets on a yearly basis to improve our mutual aid planning.
Aditional Amateurs can also be brought in from farther away if required.
