<h1>Amateur Radio Myths</h1>

<h2>Myth #1: Bringing Amateur radio operators together in an emergency equals an effective communications team.</h2>

<p>Like any activity, creating an effective team takes more than a group of people
with a common interest and skills. Creating an effective communications team that
can deploy quickly, providing communications solutions that work in their area,
starts with the average amateur radio operator, but also requires the following components;
</p>

<ul>

  <li><b>Relationships</b>
  with the agencies or organizations that use volunteer communications. In an emergency, people use what they know and trust.
  Relationships take time, but demonstrate commitment and allow an opportunity to demonstrate skills and build trust.</li>

  <li><b>Training</b>
  to understand how to communicate effectively under emergency
  conditions. Net control for an emergency is much different than the
  local weekly nets. Not all Amateurs know everything about radio operation.</li>

  <li><b>Organization and structure</b>
  so key leadership roles are in place and understood by Amateurs radio operators and the agencies or
  organizations being served. Someone must be in charge, so Amateurs know who to follow
  and agencies know who has control.</li>

  <li><b>Personal Preparedness</b>
  to ensure that the right personal and radio equipment is available and
  can be packed quickly. Clothing for several days is important,
  as is the ability to operate from multiple power sources, or to operate from
  locations without any communications infrastructure.</li>

  <li><b>Communications Preparedness</b>
  to ensure that the infrastructure in the area will be able to support
  emergency communications. If some areas have no repeater coverage and
  the other areas have repeaters without backup power, the communications
  effectiveness will be low.</li>

  <li><b>Practice</b>
  is key to anything from sports to volunteer radio communications.
  Practice sharpens skills, points our areas to work on and identifies
  problems to solve to make the groups capabilities stronger.</li>

  <li><b>Planning</b>
  is required to ensure that the group forms into a team,
  that the communications requirements are understood and that solutions
  are in place to meet those requirements.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Myth #2: Amateur radio must have the capability to set up a forward communications post in the disaster area.</h2>

<p>The thought of having a group of volunteers in the disaster core area,
not trained to first responder level of skills, makes most first responders
apprehensive. In reality, there are few reasons for Amateur radio to operate
within the disaster core, unless a specific communications capability is
requested by Police, Fire or Ambulance.
</p>

<p>It is also unlikely that Amateur radio would even operate at the
disaster perimeter, unless a specific communications capability is requested by
Police, Fire or Ambulance. There may be certain secondary organizations
that are at the disaster perimeter, supporting first responders, who
may require communications. One example may be the Salvation Army providing
food services. In the event that Amateur radio is required, the radio
operators would typically be operating from the facilities they are supporting,
rather than a separate Amateur radio communications post.
</p>

<p>In the event that an amateur radio operator is sent to the disaster
area, they must have the following 4 items or they are just another
intruder;
</p>

<blockquote>
  <table summary="Four Required Items">
    <tr><td>Coordination Contact Name:</td><td>Who is sending them</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Site Contact Name:</td><td>Who are they reporting to</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Destination Location:</td><td>Where are they reporting to</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Photo ID:</td><td>Prove who they are</td></tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>

<p>Amateur radio will be heavily involved with the EOC, shelters, hospitals
and various support organizations such as the Red Cross.
</p>

<h2>Myth #3: Municipally Officials and First Response leaders don't care or don't like volunteers.</h2>

<p>In anything there will be people who don't want to work with others,
but to blindly state that no one cares, is usually not true. The key to
making volunteer radio communications work is to build a relationship.
This may take several years and a lot of meetings to get to a good
working level relationship. It is important to educate both sides of the
discussion and to set realistic expectations. Brief status updates about meetings,
exercises and training will help keep the radio group in the mind of
others, will demonstrate ongoing commitment and shows that the group is gaining
experience.
</p>

<p>If amateurs think or imply they are some form of auxiliary force that
will deploy into the middle of a disaster, the amateurs will be disappointed
that they are not called and officials will not call because they are concerned
about having a group of people with no real purpose, in their way.
</p>

<h2>Myth #4: My local Emergency Planner should be telling me what to do.</h2>

<p>Emergency planners usually are not dedicated to only that task and usually
have a large range or emergency responsibilities, so Amateur radio is but
one small part of the total picture for them. It is highly unlikely that
the Emergency Planner has the time or the skills to establish detailed
deployment scenarios for Amateur radio.
</p>

<p>In most cases, Amateur radio volunteers are one of many resources available,
like the Red Cross or Salvation Army. The Emergency Planner is depending
on the volunteer groups to understand the area they serve, their skills
and capabilities, and to prepare themselves as much as possible to be
able to provide their services in an emergency. If there are locations or
capabilities that cannot be provided, the volunteer group should make the Emergency
Planner aware of this.
</p>

<p>The Emergency Planner is responsible to deploy the volunteer radio group
and to assist with special requirements such as shelter and transportation,
BUT the amateur group must take responsibility and accountability for its
organization, operation and ability to provide radio communications within
its area. In most cases, the radio group should have at least the following
capabilities;
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be able to establish communications at shelters</li>
  <li>Be able to establish communications at hospitals</li>
  <li>Be able to establish communications with the Red Cross</li>
  <li>Be able to provide communications to anywhere within the areas boundaries</li>
</ul>

<h2>Myth #5: The EOC is a communications centre and should include as much radio communications equipment as possible.</h2>

<p>The EOC is a communications centre and should include as much radio
communications equipment as possible.
</p>

<p>The EOC is a decision making centre and uses communications (phone,
fax, radio) to get questions and information in and to send information
back out. Police, Fire and Ambulance maintain their respective dispatch
communications locations outside the EOC, but place a representative in
the EOC for information that needs to go to the EOC.
</p>

<p>Amateur radio should operate in the same way. The Amateur radio Net
Control Station (NCS) function is like a dispatch and is not part of the
EOC communications. To be effective, the NCS function should be separate
from EOC communications. This may be a room off the EOC, a room elsewhere
in the same building or even a location in a different building. Trying
to pack everything in the EOC has several negative aspects;
</p>

<ul>

  <li>Communications capability may be compromised due to the location of the
  EOC and the high amount of radios in the area</li>

  <li>There is typically no room for operations and planning, making it difficult
  to manage resources</li>

  <li>Security is usually high, making it more difficult to change shifts.</li>

  <li>Most of the traffic is not destined to the EOC. Radio traffic will include
  communications from shelters to the Red Cross base, information to or from
  outside areas, distribution of materials to shelters or citizen patrols
  for example.</li>

</ul>

<p>It may turn out that the EOC is the only location or the best location
in your area to include the Amateur NCS function. However it is important
to understand that this is a separate function.
</p>

<h2>Myth #6: Radio Operators only take messages from designated officials, written on official message forms.</h2>

<p>The traditional military model of a radio operator as a dedicated
human-radio interface, a sort of human fax machine, responsible only to take in
official messages, in official format, signed by an officer, does not work in a
civilian emergency/disaster response. The military model works in the
military because all participants are trained at their job, to understand and
apply the model.
</p>

<p>In a disaster response, most of the support roles will be performed
by staff who have other jobs normally or by volunteers such as Red
Cross, Salvation Army, etc. Messages will be short, usually tactical, making
requests for more water, blankets, an ambulance or replying to a request for
information. There will not be any official message forms and the people will not be
familiar with the ARRL/RAC amateur message forms.
</p>

<p>Amateur radio operators will be assigned as part of the team for
various locations, such as the EOC, Red Cross, Shelters, Hospitals or Dispatch.
As the team member providing communications, other team members will
expect more than just a human fax machine.
</p>

<p>Most radio traffic will be short messages, from the local person
responsible (shelter manager, site manager).
</p>

<h2>Myth #7: Amateur radio saves lives in an emergency.</h2>

<p>Many Amateurs believe that in an emergency, Amateur radio saves lives
and that this "fact" should be promoted. While Amateurs, like every one
else in society, may find themselves in a situation where their unique
set of skills and tools is able to save a life, saving lives is not
what Amateur radio does in an emergency.
</p>

<p>Life saving is done by first responders, Police, Fire and
Paramedics.  In an emergency or disaster, Amateur radio provides
communications to groups who are helping people, typically with food,
shelter and clothing.
