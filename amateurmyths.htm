<b>If you bring a group of Amateur radio operators together in an
emergency,
you have an effective communications team</b>.
</p>
<p>Like any activity, creating an effective team takes more than a
group
of people with a common interest and skills. Creating an effective
communications
team that can deploy quickly, providing communications solutions that
work
in their area, starts with the average amateur radio operator, but also
requires the following components;
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Relationships</b> with the agencies or organizations that
use
volunteer
communications. In an emergency, people use what they know and trust.
Relationships
take time, but demonstrate commitment and allow an opportunity to
demonstrate
skills and build trust.</li>
  <li> <b>Training</b> to understand how to communicate effectively
under
emergency
conditions. Net control for an emergency is much different than the
local
weekly nets. Not all Amateurs know everything about radio operation.</li>
  <li> <b>Organization &amp; structure</b> so key leadership roles are
in
place
and understood by Amateurs radio operators and the agencies or
organizations
being served. Someone must be in charge, so Amateurs know who to follow
and agencies know who has control.</li>
  <li> <b>Personal Preparedness </b>to ensure that the right personal
and
radio
equipment is available and can be packed quickly. Clothing for several
days is important, as is the ability to operate from multiple power
sources,
or to operate from locations without any communications infrastructure.</li>
  <li> <b>Communications Preparedness</b> to ensure that the
infrastructure in
the area will be able to support emergency communications. If some
areas
have no repeater coverage and the other areas have repeaters without
backup
power, the communications effectiveness will be low.</li>
  <li> <b>Practice</b> is key to anything from sports to volunteer
radio
communications.
Practice sharpens skills, points our areas to work on and identifies
problems
to solve to make the groups capabilities stronger.</li>
  <li> <b>Planning</b> is required to ensure that the group forms into
a
team,
that the communications requirements are understood and that solutions
are in place to meet those requirements.</li>

<br>
<b>Amateur radio must have the capability to set up a forward
communications
post in the disaster area</b>.
<p>The thought of having a group of volunteers in the disaster core
area,
not trained to first responder level of skills, makes most first
responders
apprehensive. In reality, there are few reasons for Amateur radio to
operate
within the disaster core, unless a specific communications capability
is
requested by Police, Fire or Ambulance.
</p>
<p>It is also unlikely that Amateur radio would even operate at the
disaster
perimeter, unless a specific communications capability is requested by
Police, Fire or Ambulance. There may be certain secondary organizations
that are at the disaster perimeter, supporting first responders, who
may
require communications. One example may be the Salvation Army providing
food services. In the event that Amateur radio is required, the radio
operators
would typically be operating from the facilities they are supporting,
rather
than a separate Amateur radio communications post.
</p>
<p>In the event that an amateur radio operator is sent to the disaster
area, they must have the following 4 items or they are just another
intruder;
</p>
<li>Coordination Contact Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is sending
them</li>
<li>
Site Contact
Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who are they reporting to</li>
<li>
Destination
Location:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Where are they reporting to</li>
<li>

ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Prove who they are</li>

Amateur radio will be heavily involved with the EOC, shelters,
hospitals
and various support organizations such as the Red Cross.

<b>Municipally Officials and First Response leaders don't care or don't
like volunteers.</b>
<p>In anything there will be people who don't want to work with others,
but to blindly state that no one cares, is usually not true. The key to
making volunteer radio communications work is to build a relationship.
This may take several years and a lot of meetings to get to a good
working
level relationship. It is important to educate both sides of the
discussion
and to set realistic expectations. Brief status updates about meetings,
exercises and training will help keep the radio group in the mind of
others,
will demonstrate ongoing commitment and shows that the group is gaining
experience.
</p>
<p>If amateurs think or imply they are some form of auxiliary force
that
will deploy into the middle of a disaster, the amateurs will be
disappointed
that they are not called and officials will not call because they are
concerned
about having a group of people with no real purpose, in their way.

<br>
<b>My local Emergency Planner should be telling me what to do.</b>
<p>Emergency planners usually are not dedicated to only that task and
usually
have a large range or emergency responsibilities, so Amateur radio is
but
one small part of the total picture for them. It is highly unlikely
that
the Emergency Planner has the time or the skills to establish detailed
deployment scenarios for Amateur radio.
</p>
<p>In most cases, Amateur radio volunteers are one of many resources
available,
like the Red Cross or Salvation Army. The Emergency Planner is
depending
on the volunteer groups to understand the area they serve, their skills
and capabilities, and to prepare themselves as much as possible to be
able
to provide their services in an emergency. If there are locations or
capabilities
that cannot be provided, the volunteer group should make the Emergency
Planner aware of this.
</p>
<p>The Emergency Planner is responsible to deploy the volunteer radio
group
and to assist with special requirements such as shelter and
transportation,
BUT the amateur group must take responsibility and accountability for
its
organization, operation and ability to provide radio communications
within
its area. In most cases, the radio group should have at least the
following
capabilities;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Be able to establish communications at shelters</li>
  <li>Be able to establish communications at hospitals</li>
  <li>Be able to establish communications with the Red Cross</li>
  <li>Be able to provide communications to anywhere within the areas
boundaries</li>
</ul>

<b>The EOC is a communications centre and should include as much radio
communications equipment as possible.</b>
<p>The EOC is a decision making centre and uses communications (phone,
fax, radio) to get questions and information in and to send information
back out. Police, Fire and Ambulance maintain their respective dispatch
communications locations outside the EOC, but place a representative in
the EOC for information that needs to go to the EOC.
</p>
<p>Amateur radio should operate in the same way. The Amateur radio Net
Control Station (NCS) function is like a dispatch and is not part of
the
EOC communications. To be effective, the NCS function should be
separate
from EOC communications. This may be a room off the EOC, a room
elsewhere
in the same building or even a location in a different building. Trying
to pack everything in the EOC has several negative aspects;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Communications capability may be compromised due to the location
of the
EOC and the high amount of radios in the area</li>
  <li>There is typically no room for operations and planning, making it
difficult
to manage resources</li>
  <li>Security is usually high, making it more difficult to change
shifts.</li>
  <li>Most of the traffic is not destined to the EOC. Radio traffic
will
include
communications from shelters to the Red Cross base, information to or
from
outside areas, distribution of materials to shelters or citizen patrols
for example.</li>
</ul>
It may turn out that the EOC is the only location or the best location
in your area to include the Amateur NCS function. However it is
important
to understand that this is a separate function.

<b>Radio Operators only take messages from designated officials,
written
on offcial message forms.</b>
<p>The traditional military model of a radio operator as a dedicated
human-radio
interface, a sort of human fax machine, responsible only to take in
official
messages, in official format, signed by an officer, does not work in a
civilian emergency/disaster response. The military model works in the
military
because all participants are trained at their job, to understand and
apply
the model.
</p>
<p>In a disaster response, most of the support roles will be performed
by staff who have other jobs normally or by volunteers such as Red
Cross,
Salvation Army, etc. Messages will be short, usually tactical, making
requests
for more water, blankets, an ambulance or replying to a request for
information.
There will not be any official message forms and the people will not be
familiar with the ARRL/RAC amateur message forms.
</p>
<p>Amateur radio operators will be assigned as part of the team for
various
locations, such as the EOC, Red Cross, Shelters, Hospitals or Dispatch.
As the team member providing communications, other team members will
expect
more than just a human fax machine.
<br>
Most radio traffic will be short messages, from the local person
responsible
(shelter manager, site manager).

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Amateur radio saves lives in an
emergency.</span><br>
<br>
Many Amateurs believe that in an emergency, Amateur radio saves lives
and that this "fact" should be promoted. While Amateurs, like every one
else in society, may find themselves in a situation where their unique
set of skills and tools is able to save a life, saving lives is not
what Amateur radio does in an emergency. <br>
<br>
Life saving is done by first responders, Police, Fire and
Paramedics.&nbsp; In an emergency or disaster, Amateur radio provides
communications to groups who are helping people, typically with food,
shelter and clothing. <br>
