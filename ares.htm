<h2>What is ARES?</h2>

<p>
	<i>(Copied -- from the
	<a  href="external_url.htm?http://www.rac.ca/fieldorg/racares.htm">RAC Web Site</a>)</i>
</p>

<blockquote>
	<p><em>
	"ARES is composed of licensed radio amateurs who have
	voluntarily registered their qualifications and equipment for
	communications duty in the public service, when disaster strikes. Every
	licensed radio amateur, whether or not a member of RAC or any other
	local or regional organization, is eligible for membership in the
	Amateur Radio Emergency Service. The only qualification is a sincere
	desire to serve. The possession of emergency-powered equipment is
	desirable, but not a requirement.
	</em></p>

	<p><em>
	Emergency service activities in each RAC Section are under the
	direction of the Section Emergency Coordinator (SEC), who is appointed
	by the Section Manager (SM). The radio amateurs in each community
	within the Section register their facilities with the local Emergency
	Coordinator (EC), who is also appointed by the SM or SEC. In order to
	provide better support, in areas where there are a large number of EC
	appointments, the position of District Emergency Coordinator (DEC) is
	appointed by the SM. Being RAC officers, these appointments must be RAC
	members. However , as noted above, other members of a local ARES
	organization need not be RAC members."
