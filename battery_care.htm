Dead Batteries or Batteries That Don't Last Are Not Useful In An Emergency

<br/>Take Good Care Of Your Batteries!
</p>

<p>Here is an excellent link which provides information on battery types,
capacities and how to care for them
<a href="external_url.htm?http://www.buchmann.ca/toc.asp">http://www.buchmann.ca/toc.asp</a>.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Whether for remote operation, backpacking, special
events or emergency use, there is a size and capacity of battery
to fit all applications. What you do once you buy a battery will
determine its useful life. Besides physical abuse, the two things that shorten
battery life are over charging and under charging.
</p>

<p>Gel Cell batteries are often used as a portable power
source in ham radio. There are many sources for gel cell batteries,
from flea markets to alarm supply stores to electronics specialty outlets.
The price, size and condition will vary greatly.
</p>

<p>The "gel cell" is a sealed lead acid battery. The
electrolyte (acid) is stabilized by combining it with a gelling agent
or by using an absorbent plate separator. This type of battery can usually
be stored, used, charged and discharged in any position.
</p>

<p>Some lead acid batteries are designed with a plate
size imbalance or a catalyst, to help control gas generation and to aid
in deep cycle recharging. These are known as "deep cycle" batteries.
This type of battery is often associated with Marine use, where some
batteries offer boat engine starting capacity and deep cycle capacity.
</p>

<h2>Does and Don'ts</h2>

<ul>

	<li>Do Not charge batteries in a sealed container. ALL lead
	acid batteries, including gel cells, can produce hydrogen gasses.</li>

	<li>Do Not use an automotive type battery charger for gel
	cells. The output voltage is too high and will overcharge the battery.
	Overcharging shortens battery life.</li>
	<li>Do Not store a battery in a car in hot weather, under
	direct sunlight, in front of a stove or near a fire.</li>

	<li>Do Not carry the battery by the terminal connections.</li>

	<li>Not charge a battery beyond the time specified (if
	using the cycle method). If the battery is not fully charged even after
	being charged for a time longer than specified, discontinue charging
	and remove the battery from the charger.</li>

	<li>Do Not discharge A 12 volt battery below about 10.5
	to 10.7 volts (1.75 volts per cell x 6 cells). Sealed lead acid
	batteries will generally not tolerate repeated deep discharges.</li>

	<li>Always charge a new battery before use</li>

	<li>Always Install insulation covers on terminals to prevent shorts.</li>

	<li>Always install a fuse in the cable connecting to the
	battery, to protect the battery and cable from shorts. Install the fuse
	on the battery end of the cable.</li>

	<li>Always keep the battery clean.</li>

	<li>Always charge a battery that has not been used for a
	long time. The battery gradually loses its capacity due to self
	discharge during storage. Periods over which the battery can be stored without
	charging are given below in relation to storage temperatures:

		<ul>
		  <li>Below 20<sup>o</sup>C: 9 months</li>
		  <li>20<sup>o</sup>C to 30<sup>o</sup>C: 6 months</li>
		  <li>30<sup>o</sup>C to 40<sup>o</sup>C: 3 months</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

</ul>

<h2>Charging</h2>

<p>There are two considerations for charging a battery; how to charge
it quickly and how to keep it charged. Before building or buying
any battery charger, get a volt meter first. The only
way to know what is really happening with the battery, is to measure
the voltage levels. This is important over time, to ensure that the charger
is operating properly and to detect battery deterioration.
</p>

<p>Rapid charging of a battery requires a lot of user
care or a charger designed for rapid charging. Batteries can be damaged
if they are charged to fast or too long. Rapid chargers monitor the
charging rate and voltage, and adjust the charging current during the charge
cycle.
Some chargers are designed to go into maintenance mode once the battery
is fully charged which ensures that the battery is not overcharged, but
is always ready when required.
</p>

<p>Keeping a battery charged, ready for use, can be
accomplished in several ways. This same charger can typically be used to
charge the battery as well, it just does it slowly, so it may take a
day or more to reach a fully charged state. It is critical to understand
the limits of your battery to ensure that the battery is not overcharged.
</p>

<p>There are two options described in this document:</p>

<ol>
	<li>build/buy a charger</li>
	<li>use a regulated power supply with an adapter</li>
</ol>

<p>Lead acid batteries used for ham radio applications spend most of their time sitting on a shelf.</p>

<p>The sections below describe the types of charging
available, but this section jumps in with some solutions for maintaining
the battery.
</p>

<h2>Terms</h2>

<h3>Battery Cycle</h3>

<ul>
    <li>One cycle for a battery, is a discharge plus a charge</li>
</ul>

<h3>Amp-Hour Rating</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Battery capacity based on the amp-hour rating, where
	the current in amperes is multiplied by the time in hours that current
	can be drawn.</li>

	<li>For example a battery which delivers 2 amps for 20 hours,
	would have a 40 amp-hour rating.</li>

	<li>There are limits on the discharge current, so that a
	the example of a 40 amp hour battery does not mean 40 amps for 1 hour.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Deep-Cycle Battery</h3>

<ul>
	<li>This is a specially designed battery, which has thicker
	plates and a high density active material. The thick plates allow for
	reserve energy to be discharged, while not leaving the battery in a condition
	where it cannot be charged.</li>

	<li>Typically the discharge is at a slow rate, such as for
	a trolling motor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Float Voltage</h3>

<ul>
	<li>A constant voltage applied to a battery to maintain
	its capacity. This is slightly lower than the batteries full capacity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chargers</h2>

<p>There are three types of chargers for gel cell batteries:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Constant Current
		  <ul>
			<li>A small constant current is maintained through the battery for a long period of time.</li>
			<li>This type of charger is designed for a 12 to 16 hour charge time.</li>
			<li>This is the most common and least expensive charger.</li>
		  </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Constant Voltage
		  <ul>
			<li>A constant voltage is maintained across the battery terminals.</li>
			<li>When connected to the battery, there is a high initial charge current, which tapers off as the battery charges.</li>
			<li>This type of charger usually completes its cycle in 2 to 4 hours and is terminated by a timer to prevent overcharging.</li>
		  </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Constant Voltage and Current
		  <ul>
			<li>The charge current and voltage vary as the battery is charged.</li>
			<li>When the battery is connected, a moderately high charge current is supplied to the battery.</li>
			<li>The voltage rises as the battery is charged and the current is reduced. The state of charging will continue until the
				battery is removed. The maintenance current is required to make up for the batteries self discharge.</li>
			<li>Charging time takes from 6 to 12 hours depending on the batteries original condition.</li>
		  </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>More elaborate chargers will also include temperature compensation. This is required because the batteries charging
characteristics vary over a temperature range.
</p>

<h2>Charging</h2>

<p>There are two main charging methods for gel-cell batteries:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Cycle Use</li>
    <li>Float Use or Trickle Charge</li>
</ol>


<h3>Cycle Use</h3>

<p>With the cycle use charging method, the battery is
charged to its maximum capacity and is then removed from the charger.
The battery is connected to a load when required, which will discharge the
battery. The discharged voltage of the battery should not go below 10.5
to 10.7 volts (1.75 volts per cell x 6 cells).
</p>

<p>When the battery is discharged, it is connected to
the charger and is charged once again. The maximum charging voltage is
14.5 to 14.9 volts, depending on temperature (See table below).
<b>The typical value to use is 14.7 volts, which is the charge voltage at 25<sup>o</sup>C.</b>
Charging time is 6 to 12 hours, depending on the batteries state of discharge.
</p>

<p>The maximum charging current is equal to CA, where C is the batteries rated capacity and A is the initial current rating
from the battery manufacturer. The recommended maximum charging currents are:
</p>

<p>
4 Ah = 0.3 x 4 = 0.12A (120mA)
</p>

<p>
7 Ah = 0.3 x 7 = 0.21A (210mA)
</p>

<p><b>WARNING</b>: Do not exceed the maximum voltage or
current and do not leave the battery on the charger beyond the typical
12 hour limit. This will cause the battery to overcharge, leading to
permanent reduction of its capacity and premature failure.
</p>

<h3>Float Use</h3>

<p>The float use method is often mixed with the trickle
charge method, because both types use the same charging style. Float
use means that the battery is permanently installed in the circuit with the
load and the power supply/charger. When the power supply/charger fails,
the batteries supply the power. This method is used by the telephone
company to ensure that the phone system is always working.
</p>

<p>Trickle charging is associated with a battery that
is not connected to a load, but has a charger attached. The battery
must be connected to the load when required. The charger is just that, a
charger and is not capable of supplying power to the load. When the battery is
attached to the load, the charger is removed.
</p>

<p>The important difference of the float use method
over the cycle use method, is that in the float use method, the battery
is charged to a voltage that is below the maximum volts per cell for
the battery. The typical float voltage is 13.4 to 14.1 volts, depending on
temperature (See table below).
<b>The typical value to use is 13.7 volts, which is the charge voltage at 25<sup>o</sup>C</b>.

<p>The battery has less capacity when charged under
the float method, but it is possible to leave the charger attached
without damaging the battery. This is the type of charger used in alarm
systems. The charger is not sophisticated, it simply is designed not to exceed
the float voltage.
