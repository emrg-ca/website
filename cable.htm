<h1>Antenna Cable Lengths</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In dealing with local organizations regarding permanent installations,
there is always the question of what is required. When it comes to cable
for connecting to the antenna, a purest would calculate the losses associated
with RG-213 versus 1/2 or 7/8 inch heliax and then compare the cost of
more power and preamps versus changing the feeders to a lower loss variety.
There are formulas and calculations, but what are some good "rules
of thumb" that can be put to paper.
</p>

<h2>Response</h2>

<h3>VHF</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Up to 100 feet - RG-213</li>
	<li>Over 100 feet - 1/2 inch heliax</li>
</ul>

<h3>UHF</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Up to 50 feet - RG-213</li>
	<li>Over 50 feet - 7/8 inch heliax</li>
</ul>

<p>Quite often the connectors are the big problem. A set of connectors can
easily exceed the cost of the heliax for short runs. There is a new type
of heliax called LMR which is much cheaper with only a very minor performance
loss and the connectors are cheaper as well.
</p>

<p>A second rule of thumb, for UHF type N connectors are essential and
preferred, but not truly essential for VHF, where in a pinch you can get
by with type UHF (PL-259).
