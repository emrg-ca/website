<hr width="100%">The emergency communications services of EMRG are
available to the
<a href="http://www.ottawa.ca/">City
of Ottawa</a> and EMRG is included in the Cities' <a
 href="http://www.ottawa.ca/city_services/bylaws/municipal_bylaws/public_safety/emergency_plan/plan_en.pdf">official
emergency
plan</a>, on page 16.
EMRG reports to the <a
 href="http://www.ottawa.ca/city_services/emergencyserv/5_2_en.shtml">Emergency
Measures Unit</a> (EMU), but would typically
be used to provide communications for Community
Services, the City department responsible to operate and manage
shelters in an emergency. <br>
<br>
In the event that more than one group or agency has requested the
services of EMRG, the response priority is always the City of Ottawa
Emergency Measures Unit.<br>
In a situation where more than one group or agency is requesting EMRG
assistance, it is probably a common emergency and the groups or
agencies are working with the City of Ottawa. EMRG resources would be
prioritized through the Emergency Measures Unit, in consultation with
other groups, to provide the&nbsp; most effective use possible.<br>
<br>
EMRG has an excellent relationship with the City of Ottawa, through
various City of Ottawa departments. EMU and Community Services are the
primary groups EMRG works with. The Ottawa Fire Service (OFS) is an
important partner, providing infrastructure for EMRG operations within
the City. OFS provides space for the EMRG communications room and
equipment storage, as well as access to antennas within the City for
EMRG radio repeaters.<br>
<p>Providing backup communications for Public Safety radio systems is
NOT a mandate for EMRG. If the City of Ottawa radio system used by
Police and Fire failed, or if the Provincial radio system used by
Paramedics failed, EMRG would attempt to assist as much as possible. It
must be understood that there are not sufficient radios, or radio
infrastructure (repeaters) for EMRG to support more than a few key
sites, which is significantly less than the several thousand radios and
over 50 sites they normally use. This is why the radio systems used by
these agencies cost so much, because they have built in fail safe
systems to ensure that the system can operate even in a reduced mode if
something should happen to the system.<br>
</p>
<p>EMRG can provide communications for Police, Fire or Paramedics, to
support Command &amp; Control, and Interoperability, by linking key
sites that are without phone or radio communications, or offload
existing systems of non critical communications.&nbsp; This would
involve limited sites with specific purposes for the communications.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The current City of Ottawa was formed on January 1, 2001, by the
merger
of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton and 11 local
Municipalities. <br>
