		<p>Here in Ottawa the Canadian Emergency Management College runs courses for municipal officials from across the country in the operation of an Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) and in emergency site management.

		EMRG supports these efforts and strongly encourages its members to participate in the conduct of exercises conducted as a part of these courses, even if it means taking a half a day off work to do so.

		The courses run about once a month, during the day. Each course conducts 3 half day exercises. More information is included in the document
		<a href="Collegeville_Orientation_Guide.pdf">
			Orientation Guide to Collegeville For Amateur Radio Operators</a>.

		Amateurs participating get a good insight into the conduct of an EOC under emergency conditions, exercise design, and some of the ways that hams would be used in an emergency.  They also show municipal officials from across the country what their local amateur radio operators can do for them. Amateurs are initially brought in as "understudies", to allow them to become familiar with the conduct of the exercises before going "live".

		Please contact VE3FFK at his callsign at rac dot ca for more info, or preferably, to volunteer.

		As of this writing, the upcoming exercises are:
