<b><font size=+1>INTRODUCTION</font></b>
<br>This is the first news letter after some time and hopefully you have
remained an enthusiastic Emergency Measures Radio Group member during the
last year. There has been a lot of activity over this past year and it
has distracted us from our main objective, which is to be prepared to provide
communications in an emergency.
<p>EMRG now has a good solid base on which to move forward and continue
to build the skills of EMRG members. We still have the strong support of
the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton Emergency Measures Unit and
so it is now time to close the books on the past.
<p>I look forward to working with you again and thank you for your patience
and support.

<p><b><font size=+1>EMRG IS ALIVE &amp; WELL!</font></b>
<br>Despite the confusion of the last year, EMRG and the RMOC are still
working together. Two important points put forward by Harold Murphy, the
Emergency Measures Unit Coordinator;
<ul>1. The Emergency Measures Unit (EMU) for the Regional Municipality
of Ottawa Carleton (RMOC) does appreciate the value and contribution EMRG
can provide in an emergency
<p>2. The EMU is interested in seeing EMRG remain alive and well and is
willing to continue to provide the same type of assistance as it has in
the past, such as mailing news letters, picture IDs and providing meeting
space</ul>
<b><font size=+1>WHAT HAS CHANGED?</font></b>
<ul>1. EMRG has a new management team
<br>2. The team leader for EMRG will be appointed by EMRG, not the Emergency
Measures Unit, and the leader of EMRG will no longer be the Communications
Officer for the EMU.
<br>3. Repeater VA3EMV has been shut down and removed. The weekly Wednesday
net is now on VE3MPC courtesy of the Canadian Police Collage Amateur Radio
Club

<p><b><font size=+1>BACKGROUND</font></b>
<br>In December 1995, the management team for EMRG resigned due to differences
with the Emergency Measures Unit for the Regional Municipality of Ottawa
Carleton. The resignation was a personal decision and a loss for EMRG.
They put a lot of time and effort into getting EMRG where it is today.
<p>There was a period of uncertainty where no one knew for sure what had
happened or where EMRG was headed. On March 30, 1996 there was a general
membership meeting. In this meeting, a new management team was appointed
with the mandate to:
<br>> Meet with the Emergency Measures Unit to determine if there was still
interest in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; EMRG
<br>> Work to reach a new agreement between EMRG and the RMOC
<center><b><font size=+1>Are you prepared for an emergency?</font></b></center>

<p><b><font size=+1>WHAT IS EMRG?</font></b>
<br>The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) is made up of Federally licensed
radio operators, located in the Ottawa-Carleton region, who have made a
commitment to volunteer their time &amp; equipment in the event of an emergency.
EMRG members are either licensed Amateur Radio operators, or members of
the licensed XM49 Emergency Radio Squadron.
<p>EMRG is not a club, is not incorporated, owns no equipment and has no
money. EMRG acts as the interface between the Amateur radio community in
Ottawa-Carleton and the Regional Municipality of Ottawa Carleton (RMOC)
Emergency Measures Unit (EMU). It is through EMRG that the EMU would contact
local amateurs for assistance in an emergency.
<p>As an organization, EMRG provides three main functions:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1. Organizational structure for contacting volunteers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2. Training of volunteers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3. Advanced planning for emergencies
<br>&nbsp;
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<ul>EMRG members are trained communicators, not interpreters, evaluators
or field commanders. The function of members is to transmit messages which
have been given to them by responsible officials.</ul>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><font size=+1>HISTORY OF EMRG</font></b>
<br>The role of volunteer radio communications in Ottawa-Carleton, began
back in the 1950s &amp; early 60s.
<p>In 1963 the XM49 Emergency Radio Squadron (XM49ers) was enlisted by
the local EMO coordinator as a way to expand the base of radio operators
in the event of an emergency. In 1966 the XM49ers assisted during the Heron
River bridge collapse.
<p>In 1980 a new group was formed called the Emergency Measures Amateur
Radio Group (EMARG). This expanded the base of radio operators in the Region
and provided communications using repeaters.
<p>In 1990, the present Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) was formed,
bringing the Amateur Radio operators and the XM49 Emergency Radio Squadron
under one volunteer radio group. Members operate their respective equipment
and on the appropriately licensed frequencies.
<p><b><font size=+1>THE ROLE OF EMRG</font></b>
<br>In an emergency, primary communications systems for most agencies such
as police and fire, will be operating at peak capacity. EMRG’s role is
to establish a secondary communications infrastructure, as mandated by
Emergency Measures for the Regional Municipality of Ottawa Carleton. The
secondary communications infrastructure would provide communications to:
<br>> Relieve primary agencies from message traffic which is not of a critical
nature to their
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; respective functions.
<br>> Reach Agencies which do not have communications capability
<br>> Link various agencies which operate on different networks such as
Social Services,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospitals &amp; the Red Cross
<br>> Connect areas which have lost normal communications networks
<p>Under Provincial Legislation, volunteers are protected by Workers Compensation
when assisting the RMOC in a declared emergency.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+1>PUBLIC SERVICE COMMUNICATIONS</font></b>
<br>Communications for local events such as walkathons, ski races, soccer
tournaments etc. is provided by the local amateur radio clubs. EMRG is
not involved in these events because most clubs have a history of working
with specific events and the clubs draw from the same pool of local amateurs
to provide the communications.
<p>Public service communications provides an excellent training opportunity
for amateur radio operators to perfect operational skills and develop equipment
improvements.
<p><b><font size=+1>BEING PREPARED</font></b>
<br>The key to being successful in an emergency, is PLANNING and the time
to start planning for an emergency is NOW. In a disaster, repeaters may
not be operational and AC power may be out. Are you prepared to operate
self sufficiently for several hours or days?
<p>The following information is meant to get you thinking about what you
have and what you need if you are called to assist in an emergency.
<p><b>WRITING SUPPLIES</b>
<br>Pens and pencils (pencil sharpener)
<br>Note pad paper, EMRG memo forms
<br>Clip board
<p><b>MISCELLANEOUS</b>
<br>Small first aid kit for personal use
<br>Duct tape &amp; electrical tape
<br>Pocket knife
<br>Kleenex
<br>Copy of your radio license
<br>Maps of the area
<br>Small portable AM/FM radio
<br>Flashlight
<br>Personal medication
<br>Food and drinks
<p><b>EQUIPMENT</b>
<br>Batteries
<br>Power adapter for using hand held in the car or from a power supply
<br>Headphones -Needed for noisy locations
<br>Cable connectors and adapters
<p><b>Antennas</b>
<br>Build or buy spare antennas for an emergency.
<br>> 1/4 or 5/8 collapsible for an HT
<br>> Simple 2 meter 1/4 wave on an inverted connector, J-pole or role
up J-pole
<br>> Keep a length of coax (20’ to 50’) to go with the antenna. This allows
the antenna to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be outside and the operator to be inside.
<br>> Keep some pipe or other type of mast available. This can be just
a length of old pipe,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; broom handle or an elaborate collapsing
multi section mast.
<p><b>CLOTHING</b>
<br>Be prepared to survive several hours without a break
<br>Spare clothes for a change
<br>Reflective vest -Good at night
<p><b>TIPS</b>&middot;
<br>Keep the car gas tank on the full side of half a tank. Gas stations
may not be open or out of service in an emergency
<p>Start an emergency kit. This could be a box, kit bag or old brief case.
In an emergency you already have the basics in one spot. Review your emergency
kit and add to it over time. You don’t have to fill it the first time
<p>Only use the power level required for clean communication. Lower power
conserves battery life and reduces interference with other radios in the
area
