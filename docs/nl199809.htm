EMRG, the EMRG - RMOC relationship and how we can improve EMRG.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The June EMRG meeting had a small, but enthusiastic
group. Some identified areas that need improvement, while others questioned
the value of EMRG and its continued existence at all.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Please take the time to read through this newsletter
and determine your view. If at all possible, I hope you can be at the next
meeting, but if not, please feel free to call me, send an email or send
your comments through a friend.</font>

<p><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>What Is EMRG?</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>MEMBERS</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) is made
up of Federally licensed radio operators, located in the Ottawa-Carleton
region, who have made a commitment to volunteer their time &amp; equipment
in the event of an emergency. EMRG members are either licensed Amateur
Radio operators, or members of the licensed XM49 Emergency Radio Squadron.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>GROUP STATUS</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">EMRG is not a club, is not incorporated, owns no
equipment and has no money. EMRG acts as the interface between the Amateur
radio community in Ottawa-Carleton and the Emergency Measures Unit (EMU)
of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa Carleton (RMOC). It is through EMRG
that the EMU would contact local amateurs for assistance in an emergency.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">When EMRG started, there were two national amateur
groups and several amateur radio clubs in the area. For this reason, EMRG
was started as a non-partisan group which had no direct affiliations to
any club or national amateur radio group.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>CONTROL &amp; LEADERSHIP</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">EMRG is independent of the RMOC and is treated by
the Region as any other volunteer group, such as the Red Cross. The control
of EMRG resides with the EMRG Management team and the EMRG members.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The EMRG management team is made up of the Team Leader,
Operations Coordinator, Membership Coordinator and the Training Coordinator.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>GUIDING DOCUMENT</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">EMRG does not have a constitution. The guiding document
for EMRG is the EMRG Communications Plan. This document contains the information
regarding who from the RMOC can request EMRG, what role EMRG will play
in an emergency and how EMRG will operate (such as which frequencies to
use, message format, equipment available and suggested equipment setups).</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The RMOC also has a similar Communications Plan.
One component in the RMOC plan is EMRG as a communications resource. The
RMOC plan describes when and how to request EMRG assistance. It is the
EMRG communications plan that describes how that assistance will be provided.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The communications plans must be reviewed regularly
to ensure they are current.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>RMOC - EMRG AGREEMENT</font></font></b>
<dir><font face="Arial">The RMOC and EMRG have a signed agreement which
outlines the reasons for the RMOC to call on EMRG and the capabilities
that EMRG is expected to supply.</font></dir>
<font face="Arial">Prepare an emergency kit before winter. Some items to
include are:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">a small first aid kit</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">local maps, copy of your license</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">string, rope and tape</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">paper, pens/pencils</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">AM/FM radio, flashlight</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">anything else you think would help</font></li>
</ul>
<b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>LIABILITY</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">EMRG is not registered in any way and has no umbrella
insurance policy for members during exercises or training. When EMRG members
are participating in an official emergency, the RMOC is responsible and
you are eligible for workers compensation. This is set out under Ontario
law.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">If EMRG were assisting a municipality outside of
the RMOC, then that municipality would be responsible during its state
of emergency.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Personal equipment is not covered by a municipality,
even during an emergency such as the ice storm. If your radio or car is
damaged, it would be claimed under your personal insurance.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font>
<p><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>EMRG Opportunities For
The Future</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">During the last EMRG meeting, in June, there was
a mixed view of the future of Amateur radio emergency communications in
our region.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Some continue to feel that the RMOC is not interested
in using Amateur radio and see the ice storm as proof of this.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Other members believe that the RMOC does want to
work with EMRG and that EMRG still has a purpose and an important role
to play within the Ottawa-Carleton Region.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The ultimate future of EMRG is up to all of us as
members. There are areas that need to be improved and this can only be
accomplished with better leadership and more membership involvement. As
team leader, I am committed to improving my abilities in managing and motivating
us as a group. As members, we are each responsible for our own commitment.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>PUBLIC SERVICE COMMUNICATIONS</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">Communications for local events such as walkathons,
ski races, soccer tournaments etc. is provided by the local amateur radio
clubs. To date, EMRG has not been involved in these events because most
clubs have a history of working with specific events and the clubs draw
from the same pool of local amateurs to provide the communications.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">One option for EMRG to be more active, would be to
provide communications for 1 or 2 significant events per year. Public service
communications provides an excellent opportunity for EMRG members to work
together, test their equipment and develop new ideas for better communication
in the future.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Providing communications for public events would
require involvement &amp; commitment from each of us as members.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Will you be ready for this winter?</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+2>EMRG IMPROVEMENTS</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">As mentioned earlier, there are several areas that
need work. Some were identified as a result of the ice storm and others
are from member comments made at the June Meeting.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Organizational Improvements</font></b>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Create a telephone call-out list. EMRG has a membership
list, but it has not been organized enough to provide a telephone call-out
list</font></li>

<li VALUE="1">
<font face="Arial">Create an up-to-date EMRG Communications Plan. The present
plan is out-of-date and does not reflect the current EMRG-RMOC model.</font></li>
</ol>
<b><font face="Arial">Promotional Activities</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">Develop a promotional plan for EMRG (what to say
&amp; how to deliver it). Promote EMRG to:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">the public (available for use as required)</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">the RMOC (Council, police, EMU material)</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Municipalities in the Region (EMU coordinator, council,
fire)</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">local amateur radio (local clubs)</font></li>
</ul>
<b><font face="Arial">Membership Activities</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">EMRG needs to become an organization where things
are happening and where its members are active participants. This is one
of the responsibilities of the team leader to develop opportunities and
motivate the membership and of the membership to participate. Some areas
that need work, which means volunteers are required, are:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">training for all amateurs interested in emergency communications
(for example Message Handling and Net Control)</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">technical seminars, presentations on topics of interest,
construction parties (antennas, filters etc.)</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">exercises -both EMRG only and in conjunction with other
agencies.</font></li>
</ul>
<b><font face="Arial">Coordination Activities</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">Going forward, EMRG needs to develop contacts with
neighboring amateur emergency groups. The purpose of this would be to ensure
that there is a working relationship between groups with possible sharing
of information such as contact names and areas covered, equipment available.
The goal is to work together for mutual improvement.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font>
<p><font face="Arial">What do you think? What other suggestions do you
have? What level of support are you willing to commit?</font>
