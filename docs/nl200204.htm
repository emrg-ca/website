<br><b><font size=+1>Team Leaders Message</font></b>
<br>So far it has been a quiet year with respect to emergencies, although
I did get a test call from the City of Ottawa as part of their biohazard
exercise in March.
<p>There is quite a bit of activity as each of the management team members
gets their respective areas organized.&nbsp; The membership notes section
is an example, where Liz and Tom have established clear membership policies,
which should end any confusion and frustration that people felt in the
past.
<p>Clayton has been busy talking with the Red Cross about possible training
opportunities and Mike has been testing and tuning the old Ottawa Fire
Dept VHF truck duplexer cavities we received (See article on repeater extender).
<br>As always, John is keeping busy with exercise planning and how we can
work with other groups, such as the Red Cross on joint exercises. Rick
has selected a standard DC power connector for EMRG (see article on DC
power connector) and will soon have some equipment to inventory.
<p>The general meeting this month will be at a former City of Kanata fire
station on Teron Road. By moving the meetings around the City, no one has
to drive a long distance every time and it helps introduce EMRG members
to areas of the City that they may not know.
<p>The Ottawa Fire Dept is very supportive of EMRG and is pleased to make
space available for us to meet.&nbsp; With amalgamation of the Fire Dept,
some dispatch centres will close, possibly impacting EMRG access to amateur
radios in these locations. The Division Chief of Communications for the
Fire Dept has been discussing options with me, to ensure that EMRG maintains
equivalent capabilities.

<br><b><font size=+1>Low Power Communications</font></b>
<br>Having the ability to communicate effectively with low power (less
than 10 watts) radios is critical for emergency communications.
<ul>There are several reasons or situations that make low power communications
so important;
<ul>Lower power = longer battery life
<br>High power (such as mobiles) may interfere with reception on other
radios in close range (fire and ambulance)
<br>Vehicles are heavy to carry, so a hand held radio is a better choice
for places where a car cannot go</ul>

<p><br>There are several ways to improve low power communications;
<ul>Extendable antenna for HTs
<br>Portable mast and antenna
<br>Portable repeater -ensures the repeater is within range of the users
<br>Repeater extender (see next article)</ul>
</ul>
Typical amateur VHF mobile radios have 40 to 60 watts on high power, which
can be too much. Think about ways to communicate with less power. It may
make the difference in an emergency.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b><font size=+1>Membership Notes</font></b>
<br>The Ottawa EMRG/ARES membership year will run from September 1 of each
year to August 31 of the following year.
<br>Once a year, between September and the end of October, we will be requesting
updates from members who wish to remain active with the group. These can
be sent to Tom VA3WTJ and Liz VA3ELB by email, mail or telephone. For those
members who have submitted a completed application form in the previous
year, a simple confirmation of current information is satisfactory. Any
changes since the last update should be provided at that time (such as
email address and telephone number). As the callout list for any situations
requiring EMRG/ARES is based on this data, it is important that it be current.
Thus, any changes during the year should be sent to allow an accurate update
of the database.
<p>If a confirmation of information is not received at this time, it will
be assumed that the member has chosen not to be included on the active
list. In this case, they will continue to receive the newsletter for one
more year but will be placed on an inactive list. After this time, if no
update is received to confirm that the member chooses to be on the active
list, they will be taken off the mailing list and will be deemed inactive
until notice is given that they would like to be included again. At this
time, a new application form with current information will be required
for the database.
<p>Anyone who is not sure when they provided their last update can contact
us to confirm when their information was last updated. Email, if available,
is the most convenient but please use the method best for you.

<br><b><font size=+1>Repeater Extender</font></b>
<br>A "Repeater Extender" or "One Way Repeater", extends the transmit range
of hand held or other low power radios to allow access to repeaters from
areas that would normally be out of range. The drawing below shows a repeater
and its' coverage area. For the examples in this article, we will use VE3MPC
(147.150 RX 147.750 TX)
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<ul><a href="../image_files/document_images/imageMNO.JPG">Repeater Coverage
Area</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
The centre triangle is the repeater</li>

<li>
The inner circle is the coverage area where a hand held radio can clearly
transmit into the repeater</li>

<li>
The outer circle is the coverage area where a mobile can clearly transmit
into the repeater and a hand held can clearly receive from the repeater</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
In normal operation, the frequencies and communications paths for VE3MPC
would look like this:
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../image_files/document_images/imageSOO.JPG">Normal
Operation</a></blockquote>

<p><br>When using the repeater extender, the radio uses the same receive
frequency (147.150), but transmits on a simplex frequency (say 146.490).
The repeater extender receives the simplex frequency and transmits at the
same time on the repeater input frequency (147.750). The frequencies and
paths for VE3MPC with a repeater extender would look like this;
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../image_files/document_images/imageCHC.JPG">Repeater
Extender</a></blockquote>

<p><br>Programming a radio to work with the repeater extender requires
the use of the odd split capability. Amateur VHF repeaters normally use
a 600KHz difference between transmit and receive frequencies.
<p>In the future, EMRG would like to create repeater extenders for each
of the local repeaters. Part of the EMRG operations plan, would be a list
of repeater extender frequencies that EMRG members could program into their
radios for use in an emergency.
<p><u>Equipment</u>
<br>The duplexer (set of cavities) for the repeater extender project, came
from the old City of Ottawa VHF truck repeaters for the old VHF hand held
radios. The current system, uses UHF hand helds and crossband repeaters
in the trucks.
<br>In their original configuration, there were 4 cavities bolted together,
but to work with the close frequency spacing available for amateur radio,
6 cavities are required.
<p>The following photo shows the six cavity set that Mike Kelly (VE3FFK)
has configured. The cables that link the cavities together have not been
installed in this photo.
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
In the upper left corner of each cavity, is the connector which is attached
to the coupling loop (<a href="../image_files/document_images/cavities.jpg">see

<p>The <a href="../image_files/document_images/coupling_loop.jpg">final

line in each plot is 146 MHz and the top line is 0dBm.
<p>The <a href="../image_files/document_images/tx_path.jpg">first plot</a>
is for the Transmit cavities. To the right of centre is the notch for the
receive frequency of 146.490, while further to the right is the pass band
for the transmit frequency of 147.150.

band drops off after the receive frequency of 146.490 and notches the transmit
frequency 147.750.

<br><b><font size=+1>WHY TESTING PAYS OFF</font></b>
<br>The EMRG portable repeater was used for the two day Ski Marathon this
year. The repeater worked flawlessly from sun up to sun down, for two days
straight. The intense use of the ski marathon (very much like an emergency)
identified one very annoying problem. The end of transmission tone and
repeater ID were TOO LOUD. People listening to a low level voice signal
were blasted by the tone at the end of each transmission.
<p>While the repeater has been used on many occasions in the past, the
level of activity and criticality of the information never brought out
just how much of a problem the volume level of the tone and ID could be.
<br>This is an example of why exercises and practice are so important.
Finding problems during a critical situation is not a pleasant experience,
but many problems only become evident during extensive use.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b><font size=+1>STANDARD POWER CONNECTOR</font></b>
<br>EMRG now has a standard DC power connector. Equipment coordinator,
Rick Furniss (VE3IHI) reviewed various options and looked at the ARRL and
other amateur radio groups recommendations. The final selection, is the
Anderson PowerPole, available through PowerWerx in the US (www.powerwerx.com).
<br>The standard connector will be installed on all equipment used by EMRG,
including radios &amp; power supplies at the EOC, Red Cross, Fire Stations
and spares. The purpose in standardizing on a connector is to allow any
radio to work with any power supply, battery or DC adapter cable.
<p>Individual members are encouraged to use the connector, but are not
required to do so. Each member will receive one connector to build an adapter
from their personal standard to the EMRG standard and additional connectors
will be available for sale.

<p>Anderson PowerPole 15Amp Connector</center>

<p>The City of Ottawa purchased the connectors, fuse holders, red and black
wire, crimp tool and a tool box to keep it all in.

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b><font size=+1>IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR</font></b>
<br>Hamfests and garage sales are starting up, so now is a good time to
think about emergency preparation. Building up a communications emergency
kit will make your radio equipment more useful in an emergency.
<p>Keep an eye out at ham flea markets for a length of coax, a used antenna
or a spare radio. Garage sales are great places to pick up an old suitcase
or toolbox to keep a few tools, tape and cables ready for an emergency.
Adding a few items each year ensures that you&nbsp; don't spend a lot of
money, but you do get better prepared each year.

<br><b><font size=+1>CLARITY IS IMPORTANT</font></b>
<br>There were many lessons from the Swiss Air crash off Nova Scotia, but
one is not in the official records. A long time friend and Nova Scotia
ham noted that people wanted the clearest, most noise free communications
method they could find. This included amateurs, who would resort to cell
phones, instead of a noisy VHF link.
<p>In today's wireless world, people have come to expect crystal clear
communications. While in an all out emergency, people will take what they
can get, the pressure to replace noisy communications systems, will be
strong. Portable cell sites and radio systems can be deployed in fairly
short time after a disaster.
<p>Amateurs doing emergency communications planning must look at the quality
of communications capabilities that are available. Cities like Ottawa have
many repeaters, but there are areas of overlap and areas that are not served
well by any repeaters. The 50 watt mobile may just make it into the repeater,
but in an emergency, battery operation with 50 watts may be a challenge.
<p>There are ways to improve communications, including using better antennas
at remote sites, portable repeaters and repeater extenders. In some cases,
the use of CTCSS tones can allow two repeaters to operate at opposite ends
of the City, but share a common frequency. This would allow more repeaters,
without using up more VHF repeater pairs.
<p>The next time there is an event on the air, such as a soccer tournament,
bikeathon or walkathon, listen to the communications. Don't listen to the
words, listen to the quality. If this was an emergency, would you consider
all sites as providing reliable, clear communications.
<p>The point here is that there is more to radio communications than just
getting a message through after multiple resends. Signal quality is important
and we all need to ensure that we are producing and transmitting the best
signal that we can.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b><font size=+1>TRUNKED RADIO PRIMER</font></b>
<br>As many people know, the City of Ottawa is slowly moving all users
over to the EDACS trunked radio system. The original users were the police,
followed by the old Regional Transportation Dept. Now bylaw enforcement
and soon the Fire Dept will share a common radio system. But what is trunked
radio and why is it so popular.
<p>In conventional Mobile Radio systems, each agency would have its own
dedicated radio system for Police, Fire, Bylaw enforcement, etc. Each system
must have enough capacity to handle an emergency, but under normal conditions,
the system is underutilized. There are periods of time, when each agency
experiences overload and low use, but there is no way to share capacity
between agencies.
<p>In trunking systems, all users share a common set of radio channels.
Whenever the push-to-talk (PTT) button is pressed, the system finds a free
radio channel and assigns it to the call. A new radio channel is assigned
for each press of the PTT button, even during the same conversation.
<p>If all channels are in use, the call is automatically queued until a
new channel becomes free. Free channels are assigned to
<br>the queued calls on a first-in, first-out basis, unless there are overriding
priorities assigned to the user or the group. By setting user priority
levels, if only one channel is available and a police officer and water
works employee both tried to make a call, the system would assign the channel
to the police officer.
<p>Trunked radio systems get their name from the trunk line used in commercial
telephone communications. A trunk is a communications path between two
or more points, typically between the telephone exchange and one or more
users, or between two or more radio channels.
<p>Trunking ensures highly efficient use of available radio spectrum and
virtually eliminates the delay traditionally experienced when trying to
get a clear radio channel.
<p>Next time; fleets &amp; subfleets.
