<p><b><font size=+1>Team Leaders Message</font></b>
<br>Since the last EMRG general meeting a lot of great things have happened
with and for EMRG.&nbsp; Some of these events are captured in this newsletter
and others will be discussed at the Sept meeting.
<p>This time last year, we set out to make sure EMRG would have a year
of steady activity and that we would be back as a group to do even more
this year. Having a great team has helped to distribute the work, which
is showing great benefits.&nbsp; We had training at each meeting, there
were two exercises and the membership database is organized. I think we
can look forward to an even better year ahead.
<p>Sept 11 is in the news and minds of many people right now. There have
been many articles written about the various groups that were involved,
including several articles in commercial magazines, talking about the role
of amateur radio. The key elements behind the success were pre-planning
and portable equipment.
<br>If you know someone who might be interested in EMRG, let them know
about the meeting.

<p><b><font size=+1>Events Earlier This Year</font></b>
<br><u>Emergency Preparedness Week Display</u>
<br>On May 6, EMRG participated in a display at the Cartier Drill hall,
next to City Hall. This was a joint Federal, Provincial and City planned
event to kick off Emergency Preparedness Week. This event provided a great
opportunity for EMRG to talk to people from other agencies from different
levels of Government. The booth was 10' x 10' and the displays covered
all aspects of Amateur communications from HF to APRS. There are a few
pictures on the EMRG web site.
<p><u>Exercise Integration</u>
<br>John Senez, EMRG exercise planner was sitting at the table as a partner
in exercise planning for the Ottawa Airport exercise. The actual exercise
took place on Thursday May 23, but the planning took several months, including
several all day meetings. This exercise was a great step forward and shows
the credibility that EMRG has developed with other agencies.
<br>The exercise involved a plane crash near the airport, into a residential
area. EMRG provided radio communications from the shelter, but also provided
backup for the hospitals when they simulated a failure of their intra hospital
radio system.
<p><u>Hospital Disaster Planning Committee</u>
<br>The Airport exercise strengthened the relationship between EMRG and
the Ottawa Hospitals. While EMRG was always recognized by the Hospitals
as a backup communications resource, deploying EMRG operators to various
hospitals and demonstrating what can be done added a lot of credibility.
<br>EMRG is now a member of the Hospital Disaster Planning Committee as
shown on the pamphlet below. (see just below the middle)
<center><a href="../image_files/document_images/HospitalConfPamplet.jpg">Hospital
Pamphlet</a></center>

<p>The Hospital Disaster Planning Committee has also asked EMRG to provide
an amateur radio display at their annual disaster planning conference in
October. This is a large scale event, attracting people from all over the
Province. The EMRG name appears again in the pamphlet as one of the exhibitors.

<p><b><font size=+1>R Is For Radio</font></b>
<br>In an emergency, most EMRG communications will take place on Amateur
Radio frequencies, but it is important to remember that the R in EMRG is
for Radio, any radio. In an emergency, the same operations and technical
skills that are applied for Amateur Radio can also be applied to CB, FRS,
Marine or Commercial frequencies. If a community is isolated by a disaster,
people will try to communicate with what they have. Being prepared to communicate
on these other frequencies is part of the value EMRG can provide in an
emergency.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><font size=+1>City Radio Equipment</font></b>
<br><u>City Of Ottawa Surplus Equipment</u>
<br>For many years there has been talk about what happens to the existing
radio equipment as various agencies in Ottawa migrate to the EDACS trunked
radio system. Some of the migration started under the old RMOC and continues
under the new City of Ottawa. Ottawa Fire Dept is the next major agency
to switch.
<br>While many vehicle and portable radios have been changed already, some
repeaters and base stations that were turned off are only now being removed.
All equipment must be inventoried and matched with the original equipment
inventories from multiple former Municipalities and agencies.
<p>Some equipment from Ottawa Police has been used temporarily by the amalgamated
Ottawa Fire Dept to provide multi channel radios in all vehicles, so all
fire channels could be shared across the City. With the emphasis on migrating
radio users to EDACS and the amalgamation into one City, equipment removal
and sale has had a low priority.
<br>The topic of getting access to some of this equipment for EMRG is now
officially underway. Harold Murphy from the
<p>Emergency Measures Unit (EMU) requested a list of equipment that EMRG
would be interested in as a starting point. EMU, Ottawa Fire and EMRG representatives
will meet in the next month to discuss options and try to identify specific
equipment.
<p><u>EMRG Equipment Philosophy</u>
<br>Until now, EMRG has intentionally stayed away from owning equipment,
preferring to use the repeater infrastructure owned by local clubs and
radios owned by EMRG members. However this is a once in a lifetime opportunity
to get access to key City radio sites and to get equipment to put in them.
The objective is to seek equipment that can improve the general Amateur
Radio infrastructure in Ottawa (repeaters) and enhance EMRGs capabilities
to respond in an emergency. This is not about getting free radios for everyone.
<p>The infrastructure (repeater) emphasis is on being able to provide hand
held coverage across the City. There are many areas not covered by local
repeaters, or only covered with a high powered mobile radio.
<br>The other area of concern is building an inventory of equipment that
can be packaged and ready for deployment as complete shelter kits, cross-band
repeater systems for use at remote locations or for communications from
inside a building, such as a Hospital.
<p>This is an important opportunity to ensure that EMRG has the equipment
required to meet the needs for today and in the future. It is also an opportunity
for amateurs that are interested, to get a chance to do some hands on work
with communications equipment that would not normally be part of amateur
operation.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><font size=+1>Thanks To Local Clubs</font></b>
<br>One of the best ways to keep in touch with local amateurs is to visit
the ham flea markets. This year EMRG had a booth at the two Ottawa flea
markets, the Ottawa Valley Mobile Radio Club (OVMRC) in the spring and
the Ottawa Amateur Radio Club (OARC) this fall.
<p>Both clubs provide a table at no cost and are very accommodating of
our needs. Thanks to both clubs for their continued support!
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><font size=+1>Portable Repeater</font></b>
<br>The portable repeater was forced to move to a new frequency earlier
this year. The frequency is now:&nbsp; 145.110 MHz – . There is an output
tone on the repeater of 136.5kHz.

<p><b><font size=+1>EMRG MEMBERSHIP</font></b>
<br><u>Yearly Updates (Its really easy this year)</u>
<br>It is time once again for membership updates from everyone who wishes
to remain active with the group. If you submitted an application form in
the previous year, a simple confirmation that there are no changes and
that you want to remain on the list is all that is required. Please let
Tom VA3WTJ or Liz VA3ELB know by email, mail or telephone.
<p>If there are changes since your last update these should be provided,
such as a new email address or telephone number. The membership year runs
from September 1 of each year to August 31 of the following year.
<br>Membership List Organization
<p>The purpose of maintaining an EMRG membership list is to ensure that
contact information is accurate and to confirm who wants to participate
in EMRG. The membership list is used for several things,
<br>&nbsp; - to generate a call up list
<br>&nbsp; - to maintain a list at EMU, so in an emergency information
about EMRG members is already on file
<br>&nbsp; - to mail the newsletter
<p>The membership list is organized into three categories; Active, Inactive
and Archived.
<br><b><u>Active List</u></b>
<br>Members on the active list have either filled in a membership form
or notified Tom &amp; Liz that they want to remain as EMRG members for
the year.
<br>Active members are expected to participate in training, exercises and
meetings (as often as time will allow, we all have a life) and will receive
a copy of the newsletters.
<p><b><u>Inactive List</u></b>
<br>The inactive list includes everyone who was an active member last year,
but who does not provide an update this year.&nbsp; The lack of an update
could be because they forgot, personal circumstances just don't leave enough
time for other activities, or they are no longer interested.
<br>Inactive members are viewed as potential active members, so they continue
to receive the newsletters.
<p><b><u>Archived List</u></b>
<br>When no update is received for two years in a row, the name is moved
into the archive list. At this point it is assumed that the person does
not have time, has moved or is truly not interested. The newsletter is
not sent to names in the archive list.
<br>Anyone who is not sure when they provided their last update can contact
Tom &amp; Liz to confirm when their information was last updated. Email,
if available, is the most convenient but please use the method best for
you.

<p><b><font size=+1>EDACS –Trunked Radio</font></b>
<br>The former RMOC initially implemented the EDACS radio system, first
for the amalgamated Police Dept, then public works and now all City agencies
will be transferred. But what is EDACS [Enhanced Digital Access Communications
System].
<p>EDACS is a radio communications system that provides fault-tolerant,
high-speed, wireless analog voice, digital voice and data communications.
Each transmitter tower has it's own group of frequencies, one of which
is a control channel. The system can choose ANY of the frequencies for
the Control Channel. The EDAC System is limited to 25 frequencies per tower
site. The computer controlled radio system instantly assigns a random channel
for each transmission by sending digital information over the control channel.
Each call will be on a different channel. Transmissions can be simulcasted
over all transmitter towers or sent to an individual tower to cover only
a certain area. The system controller is programmed to detect interference
on any of the frequencies and cease all operations on that frequency until
a specified time elapses after the interference stops. If the radio is
lost or stolen, it can be locked out by the system.
<p>EDACS Logical ID's (LID). A LID is a numeric ID assigned to each radio
during it's programming that will specifically ID that radio on the system.
It is used to display the name or ID of the individual originating the
transmission as well as to the system for it's permissions and denials
of groups/features. The dispatcher can detect if a person is transmitting
on a portable or a car radio because each unit has a different ID. Some
radios are not allowed to use the telephone interconnect, make individual
calls and some are not even allowed to transmit. This is all controlled
via the logical ID of the radio. The LID is also used to make individual
calls, you have to know or have pre-programmed the LID of the radio you
want to have an I-Call with.
<p>Group calls are the standard calls made on a trunked radio system. Groups
are the trunked equivalent of conventional channels. A user can call another
group without having to know who is currently in that group. Groups are
normally collections of users who need to communicate with each other regularly.
<br>Groups are split into a hierarchical structure, comprising the system,
agencies, fleets, and subfleets. This structure permits flexible partitioning
of users who may be split geographically and organizationally. In this
way several user groups can co-exist on the same system, without unnecessary
interference. This makes EDACS particularly suitable for shared networks,
where several organizations share the same radio infrastructure.
<p>For example, a community-wide system has been divided into a small number
of agencies, such as police and fire services. These agencies can be split
further into fleets, such as police districts 1 and 2, or North and South
fire stations. Each police district can be further broken down into subfleets,
such as detectives, traffic, patrols, etc. All subordinate subfleets will
hear a fleet call, and all subordinate fleets and subfleets will hear an
agency call. This allows authorized users to make general announcements
to certain user groups. In competing systems lacking a fleet structure,
there is no convenient way to communicate with multiple groups simultaneously.
