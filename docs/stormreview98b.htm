<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">Amateur radio has proven to be an important resource
in most major emergencies. During the ice storm in January 1998, there
was a lot of activity from amateur radio operators assisting with the emergency.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The amateur activity was typically part of three
main activities:</font></dir>

from the Cumberland Emergency Radio Group (CERG).</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">CERG was running a network control station full time,
so the Red Cross had been using the radio operators provided by CERG to
relay information to other areas within the Region and bordering communities.
The Red Cross was concerned that Cumberland would end its emergency, causing
CERG to shut down.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">When contacted by Peter Gamble on Jan 12, the chairman

<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">There are amateurs in the area, who were upset
that the Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) was not called in by the
Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton (RMOC) Emergency Measures Unit
(EMU) to assist in the emergency. This section attempts to pull together
information key to this discussion.</font></dir>
</dir>
<b><font face="Arial">3.2 EMRG DESCRIPTION</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) is made
up of Federally licensed radio operators, located in the Ottawa-Carleton
region, who have made a commitment to volunteer their time and equipment
in the event of an emergency. EMRG members are either licensed Amateur
Radio operators, or are members of the licensed XM49 Emergency Radio Squadron.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">EMRG is not a club, is not incorporated, owns no
equipment and collects no money. EMRG acts as the interface between the
amateur radio community in Ottawa-Carleton and the Regional Municipality
of Ottawa-Carleton, Emergency Measures Unit (EMU).</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
<b><font face="Arial">3.3 RMOC-EMRG AGREEMENT (Key sections)</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">The RMOC and EMRG have a signed agreement which
outlines the reasons for the RMOC to call on EMRG and the capabilities
that EMRG is expected to supply. The two key sections relating to the RMOC
use of EMRG are:</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">SERVICES</font></b></dir>
</dir>

<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">In the event of an emergency within the meaning of the
Emergency Plans Act, R.S.O 1990, c.E.9 (hereinafter referred to as "emergency"),
as declared by the RMOC, the EMRG may be called upon to provide, to the
best of its ability, radio operators for the duration of the emergency
for the purpose of providing back-up communications services.</font></li>
</ol>
</ol>

<dir>
<dir><b><font face="Arial">RMOC RESPONSIBILITIES</font></b></dir>
</dir>

<ol START=12>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Notification of an emergency shall be issued by the
RMOC Environment and Transportation Commissioner or his authorized representative
to any one or more of the EMRG’s members identified on the contact list.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">The RMOC is not obliged to utilize the back-up communication
services of EMRG or its members.</font></li>
</ol>
</ol>
<b><font face="Arial">3.4 REASONS FOR EMRG TO BE ACTIVATED</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">Summarizing the sections from the RMOC-EMRG agreement
and adding a bit of explanation, there are really three reasons for the
RMOC to call on the services of EMRG:</font></dir>
</dir>

<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">If during an emergency, existing communications within
all or a portion of the Region fail or become overloaded such as:</font></li>
</ol>
</ol>

<ul>
<dir>
<dir>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Failure or overload of any or all of the mobile radio
systems used by police, fire, regional works etc.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Failure of phone communications both wired or wireless</font></li>
</ul>
</dir>
</dir>
</ul>

<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">If during an emergency, communications systems do not
exist for a specified purpose. This could be a way to provide:</font></li>
</ol>
</ol>

<ul>
<dir>
<dir>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">A common radio system for agencies that do not have
radios or have their own private radio systems on different frequencies</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Communications to an area or building that is not equipped
with communications capabilities suitable for the task at hand</font></li>
</ul>
</dir>
</dir>
</ul>

<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">If a municipality within the RMOC or an agency assisting
the RMOC, requests assistance with communications AND the RMOC is unable
to meet that request with its existing resources.</font></li>
</ol>
</ol>
<b><font face="Arial">3.5 WHY EMRG WAS NOT CALLED</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">While the ice storm created a lot of activity and
did stress communications systems within the Region, at no time was the
RMOC without communications or without a solution to restore communications.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Based on the RMOC-EMRG agreement and the communications
requirements of the RMOC during the emergency, the RMOC did not have a
communications task for EMRG. Therefore EMRG was not called.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial">It is important to understand that this does not
mean that amateur involvement was not happening or that more could not
have been used.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial">It means that the RMOC had no internal need for
additional communications and no outside groups such as local municipalities
or the Red Cross had requested assistance with communications.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial">There were some important points made regarding what
effect there would have been if EMRG was activated part way through the
emergency. Some points of question are:</font></dir>
</dir>

<ul>
<dir>
<dir>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">With many EMRG members already working in Cumberland
and other areas, how many additional resources would have been added if
EMRG had been called out?</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">While Cumberland took on duties beyond it’s formal boundaries,
CERG also had access to the bulk of the amateur radio operator resources.
If EMRG had been active over the entire Region, Cumberland may have had
less resources, not more</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Activating EMRG during the emergency would have established
a new central Net Control Station (NCS) in the Region, but what would this
have done beyond the expanded role being done by CERG. While a central
NCS would be best, is the middle of an emergency a good time to change?</font></li>

<b><font face="Arial">4.1 CUMBERLAND EMERGENCY RADIO GROUP</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">The Cumberland Emergency Radio Group (CERG) was
officially called in by the municipality of Cumberland on Wednesday Jan
7. The role of CERG is to provide amateur communications within the Township
of Cumberland.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Initially CERG was only serving the Township of Cumberland,
providing communications for basement pumping, generators and shelters.
CERG used amateur volunteers gathered through radio contacts or phone calls.
Many of the volunteers are members of the Emergency Measures Radio Group.
As the severity of the emergency progressed, the boundaries of CERG spread.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
<b><font face="Arial">4.2 THE EXPANDED ROLE OF CERG</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">It is important to understand that the Cumberland
Emergency Radio Group (CERG) was operating on local amateur repeaters with
wide spread coverage across the Region and the frequency was controlled
by the CERG Net Control Station (NCS). For several days, CERG was operating
24 hours a day and during this time, it evolved to become the focal point
for all amateur related activities in the area.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Three activities now spread the role of CERG beyond
the boundaries of Cumberland:</font></dir>
</dir>

<ol>
<dir>
<dir>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">The Red Cross was using the CERG Net Control Station
to access amateurs throughout the Region and into communities on the edge
of the RMOC</font></li>

<li VALUE="1">
<font face="Arial">Local amateurs throughout the Region and surrounding
communities were checking into the CERG NCS to relay information from areas
not covered by the repeater used by CERG, pose questions for residents
in their area and to offer their services</font></li>

<li VALUE="1">
<font face="Arial">Small communities on the edge of the Region were now
into the emergency for several days without power and the temperature was
dropping. These communities were mounting patrols to go door to door checking
on residents, but they needed communications between the patrols and local
fire hall or shelter.</font></li>

</ol>

<ul>
<dir>

<dir>
<dir>

<b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>5.0 OBSERVATIONS &amp; IMPROVEMENTS</font></font></b>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Requests for assistance must originate at the problem
source, be sent to the destination that can assist and they must be clear
and to the point</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">During an emergency, the role of amateur radio operators
goes beyond just forwarding messages. Amateurs may be requested to become
active volunteers</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">There is a need for a central control point for amateur
radio during an emergency and EMRG is in the best position to provide this.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">It appears that many municipalities were not aware of
amateur radio as a resource, so therefore did not make a request for assistance</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><font face="Arial">5.1 REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">Requests for assistance during an emergency need
to follow two important criteria:</font></dir>
</dir>

<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">The request should be from the person/group/organization
looking for assistance, to the person/group/organization from whom assistance
is being requested.</font></li>
</ol>
</ol>

<ul>

<b><font face="Arial">5.2 THE ROLE OF AMATEUR RADIO</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><b><font face="Arial">Traditional Model</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">The traditional model (Present RMOC-EMRG agreement)
has amateur radio as a resource to provide communications. This view has
radio operators at strategic locations, sending formal messages between
locations. These messages could be local requests for supplies or requests
to or from the Red Cross to anywhere in Canada asking for status on a loved
one.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In this traditional model the amateur radio operator
does not originate any messages, they are prepared by an official, on a
message form. The radio operator then passes (sends) this traffic (message)
to another amateur radio operator for routing towards its destination,
or directly to the radio operator at the destination location.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">At the destination location, the radio operator receives
the message, recording in on a new message form. The completed message
form is handed to the official listed as the recipient. With this model,
amateur radio operators become a type of intelligent facsimile network,
taking messages in at one end and reproducing it at the other end.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Participant Model</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">During the ice storm emergency, radio amateurs operated
under a different model which I call the Participant Model. In the participant
model, radio operators were active volunteers with radios, using radio
as a means to report progress and status of their volunteer activity.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In the participant model, there is still a net controller
and their are still designated officials. However a shortage of volunteers
may mean that the radio operator is doing more than just providing communications.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">This model does not suggest that the radio operator
is overburdened with activities. What it does mean is that the radio operator
may also be driving the delivery vehicle, rather than riding along as the
passenger radio operator.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The participant model is really about cooperation,
after all this is an emergency situation. Radio operators may be called
on to do more than just provide radio communications, because that is what’s
required at the time.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">This does not imply that there is no control and
that radio operators can be directed by anyone anywhere. It simply means
that the radio coordinator, in conjunction with emergency officials and
radio operators, may agree to do more than just provide radio communications.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">SUMMARY OF THE ROLE OF AMATEUR RADIO</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">Be flexible to provide the most assistance possible.
There will still be a need for formal messages between some locations,
but many amateur radio operators will be working directly in the field,
providing more than just radio communications.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Flexibility and individual preparation are important
to success. Amateur radio operators need to be able to respond to a variety
of situations, locations and duties.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
<b><font face="Arial">5.3 CENTRAL COORDINATION OF AMATEUR RADIO</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">When the emergency began, amateur radio operators
started to check into local repeaters, looking for a focal point. Some
of these were people offering assistance, some were offering or looking
for information and others were in motion already providing assistance
in some way.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">During the height of the emergency there were several
pockets of amateur radio operating in and around the Region. Each of these
groups had similar requirements:</font></dir>
</dir>

<ul>
<dir>
<dir>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Provide communications within their area</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Communicate with the Red Cross in Ottawa</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Communicate with other amateurs for pooling of resources</font></li>
</ul>
</dir>
</dir>
</ul>

<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">The RMOC is looked to as the centre or core of
the Region where people look for leadership and assistance. In that same
way, amateur radio operators look to the Emergency Measures Radio Group
to provide a central control and administration for amateur radio.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The Cumberland Radio Group provided this central
function during the emergency. However CERG was called out when the Township
of Cumberland declared an emergency. Once Cumberland ends its state of
emergency, CERG would theoretically shut down, even though there are other
areas still in a state of emergency. This would have left a hole in the
amateur communications structure.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">With the present model for EMRG, activation is only
at the request of the RMOC and that is only if communications is required
by the RMOC. There is a need for EMRG to operate as a net control station
during an emergency to establish a central focal point. Should this be
done outside of the RMOC or incorporated into the RMOC response?</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Emergency communications for amateur radio can be
of two types:</font></dir>
</dir>

<ol>
<dir>
<dir>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Registered volunteer for a municipal government or agency
such as the Red Cross or Saint John Ambulance</font></li>

<li VALUE="1">
<font face="Arial">Non registered volunteer using amateur radio to help
people in any way possible.</font></li>
</ol>
</dir>
</dir>
</ol>

<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">Two important distinctions between the two items
above are:</font></dir>
</dir>

<ol>
<dir>
<dir>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Recognition by other groups or agencies</font></li>

<li VALUE="1">
<font face="Arial">Liability coverage ( Non registered volunteers operate
at their own risk)</font></li>
</ol>
</dir>
</dir>
</ol>

<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">EMRG can establish a net control station outside
of the RMOC. This would require a location (perhaps some ones house) but
there would be two missing elements, contact with other agencies and liability
coverage.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">RECOMMENDATION</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">In the event of an emergency, where the RMOC is involved,
EMRG should be part of the early response. The initial EMRG involvement
would be to establish a presence within the amateur radio community through
a net control station operating from the EOC.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
<b><font face="Arial">5.4 EMRG AS A RESOURCE FOR ASSISTANCE</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">The important distinction that resulted in EMRG
not being called out during this emergency, was the fact that there were
no requests for communications assistance made to the RMOC from local municipalities
or the Red Cross that required EMRG.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Knowing the state of chaos that existed in many small
municipalities, the actual use of amateur radio during the emergency and
the last minute attempts to use amateur radio, it appears that these small
municipalities were not aware of amateur radio as a resource so therefore
did not make a request for assistance.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In most cases, these areas lack a means of providing
mobile communications that can cover a dispersed area. Some of the problems
are:</font></dir>
</dir>

<ul>
<dir>
<dir>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">No pool of extra radios on hand (Cannot afford it)</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Hand held radios don’t provide sufficient coverage</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Local obstacles may limit communications without a repeater</font></li>
</ul>
</dir>
</dir>
</ul>

<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">The main reasons for these areas to use amateur
radio are for:</font></dir>
</dir>

<ul>
<dir>
<dir>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Local communication such as door to door patrols or
shelter to operations centre (Some rural shelters do not have convenient
phone access, use pay phones or only have 1 line available)</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Communications to central locations such as the Red
Cross for shelter supplies</font></li>
</ul>
</dir>
</dir>
</ul>

<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">The present EMRG agreement is with the Regional
Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton. One way to provide assistance to local
municipalities would be for EMRG to establish individual agreements with
each municipal unit within the Region. These agreements would all need
to identify EMRG’s primary responsibility to the RMOC.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">This is really a two part issue:</font></dir>
</dir>

<ol>
<dir>
<dir>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">How to make local municipal leaders aware of amateur
radio as a communications resource</font></li>

<li VALUE="1">
<font face="Arial">Establish a means for these municipalities to access
amateur radio assistance if they need it during an emergency</font></li>
</ol>
</dir>
</dir>
</ol>

<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">Once item 2 is resolved, information can be provided
from many sources including EMRG, Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC), Preparedness
Canada and groups who have successfully used amateur radio communications
during an emergency.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Resolution of item 2 can take two possible forms:</font></dir>
</dir>

<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Establish the RMOC as the central point through which
municipalities can make requests for communications assistance. This needs
to be discussed with the RMOC to see if it fits within their mandate. Some
advantages include:</font></li>
</ol>
</ol>

<ul>
<dir>
<dir>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">There is only one agreement to maintain</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">This ensures that the RMOC is the focal point, so it
is easier to serve more than one municipality</font></li>
</ul>
</dir>
</dir>
</ul>

<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Establish individual agreements for EMRG with each municipal
unit. There are downsides to this, such as:</font></li>
</ol>
</ol>

<ul>
<dir>
<dir>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">This creates a lot of work to establish and maintain
the agreements</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">There is a finite quantity of amateur radio operators
so this resource must be distributed across municipalities if more than
one municipality has a state of emergency. Amateur radio communications
cannot be assigned on a first come first served basis</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">EMRG must interface directly with all the municipalities
involved, including explaining during an emergency why resources are being
moved from one municipality to another</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">It appears we are headed for reduced municipal government
with the mega city concept, so expending effort to establish individual
agreements may be a short lived solution</font></li>
</ul>
</dir>
</dir>
</ul>

<dir>
<dir><b><font face="Arial">RECOMMENDATION</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">The RMOC should be the central point of contact for
amateur radio communications assistance in the Region. This needs to be
discussed with the RMOC and if acceptable, communicated to the local municipal
units along with some information on what amateur radio can provide.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
<b><font face="Arial">5.5 EMRG &amp; THE RED CROSS</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">In the past, there was an agreement between EMRG
and the Red Cross, but this agreement became void with the new RMOC-EMRG
agreement. The Red Cross and EMRG did plan to set up a meeting to discuss
the possibility and requirements for an agreement, but the meeting never
took place due to schedule conflicts and was never pursued by the EMRG
team leader.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The role of EMRG and the possibility of assisting
the Red Cross in an emergency needs to be explored to see if the Red Cross
has requirements that could be met by working with EMRG.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
<b><font face="Arial">5.6 WORKING TOGETHER</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">There are several groups in and around the Region
who provide voluntary emergency communications. One item that came from
the debriefing session held by the Cumberland Emergency Radio Group, was
a need to get together and coordinate resources and activities to ensure
the best possible assistance can be made available in the area regardless
of the boudoirs which define each group.</font></dir>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">There were around 100 people answering the special RMOC

<li>
<font face="Arial">The usual dispatch and coordination for the Regional
works crews, called "Window On The Region" was busy with an increased load.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">The press conferences were held every day so people
had to prepare information for each department, ensure outside visitors
made it to the room and the room had to be ready to seat all the people
and they had to have working microphones.</font></li>

coordination and support activities</font></li>
</ul>
</dir>

</ul>
<b><font face="Arial">6.2 THE EOC COMMUNICATIONS ROOM</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">The layout of the EOC communications is a rectangular
room with two rows of operator positions, one on each side wall. Each position
is assigned to a specific organization and is equipped with a radio and
telephone. Some of the organizations represented are Police, fire, OC Transpo,
Red Cross, Regional Hospital and EMRG.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">EMRG has four operator positions in the EOC communications
room, one with no radio, two with tri band radios and one with a 2M only
radio. There is a TV monitor at one end of the room and a large rectangular
table in the middle of the room.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
<b><font face="Arial">6.3 ACTIVITY IN THE EOC</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">The traditional view of the role of the communications
room, is as the radio communications centre with a series of radio operators,
each representing an agency involved in the emergency. Messages to and
from the EOC, flow through these operators.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">It is important to understand that within the EOC
communications room,</font>
<p><font face="Arial">there were the normal groups such as fire, police
and OC Transpo, but they were very low profile. However there were additional
activities within the communications room that were very noticeable. During
the emergency, there was an ongoing activity of:</font></dir>
</dir>

<ol>
<dir>
<dir>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Recording requirements and placing them in a priority
based list for generators, heat, water etc.</font></li>
</ol>
</dir>
</dir>
</ol>

<ul>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">This included places such as nursing homes, shelters,
private homes with medical equipment that required power and farmers</font></li>
</ul>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</ul>

<ol>
<dir>
<dir>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Finding sources of wood, fuel, candles etc.</font></li>

<li VALUE="1">
<font face="Arial">Finding generators of all sizes from across Canada and
then coordinating:</font></li>

</ol>

<ul>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<dir>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">What size is the generator, watts &amp; voltage</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">How to get the generator if it can’t be delivered</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Keeping track of where the generator came from, where
it was at all times and how to return it to its owner</font></li>
</ul>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</dir>
</ul>

<ol>
<dir>
<dir>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Shelter support such as delivering supplies for the
Red Cross and getting generators for sites with no power</font></li>

<li VALUE="1">
<font face="Arial">Water coordination for people needing water, mostly
farmers and pumping for those who had too much water</font></li>
</ol>
</dir>
</dir>
</ol>

<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">The busiest activity by far was the generators.
This activity involved 6 people full time, made up of people from the RMOC,
Ontario Hydro, plus one military person. This group had to look at each
request based on priority and power required. Every generator, including
those provided by the military had to be listed and identified by its capacity
before it could be put into the field.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The generators had various kilowatt ratings from
1KW up to 700KW. They also had various voltage ratings such as 110V, 240V
&amp; 660V. Farmers needed high capacity (30KW) generators rated at 240V,
while many shelters or nursing homes needed similar wattage but 660V. There
was not always a generator available to match the need.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Coordination of generators was also linked to other
participants in the emergency. For example getting a generator to a nursing
home, avoided the need to evacuate the nursing home. As the emergency progressed,
and some areas had power restored, the generators were moved to other locations.
This coordination activity kept up a feverish pace during the entire emergency.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
<b><font face="Arial">6.4 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">The space in the communications room was at a premium.
With the generator coordination, they required access to phones and to
white boards. One temporary white board was brought into the room and another
was installed on the wall after a few days. Three of the four EMRG positions
were in use for this, as was the middle table.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Items which were not originally integrated into a
communications room are extra convenient power outlets for computers, printers
and cell phone battery chargers. These items also require space which is
not available within an operating position causing organizations such as
the police to spread out onto the middle table for their computer. There
was also a FAX machine which took up one unused operating position, not
out of carelessness, but because it needed a phone line and there was really
nowhere else it could go.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
<b><font face="Arial">6.5 EMRG OPERATIONAL STATUS</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">The RMOC and EMRG are aware that there are some
problems with the antenna system at the RMOC for the EMRG radio positions.
This is been under investigation, but was not resolved prior to the emergency.
In preparation for a possible call out, Peter Gamble, EMRG team leader
tested the radio positions, finding that now none of the radio positions
had a usable antenna.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">With a couple trips to the roof, a car magnet mount
antenna and a lot of SWR testing, two antennas were made operational into
the EMRG operator positions. One antenna was a tri bander and one was a
5/8 mobile for 2M only.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The radios in the EOC have not been programmed and
tested. During the emergency, the two Kenwood tri band radios were programmed
and tested, as well as two hand held dual band radios. Operating out of
the EOC identified some areas for improvement, such as:</font></dir>
</dir>

<ul>
<dir>
<dir>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">The radio must be separated from the power supply because
with the mobile radio mounted on top of the power supply, the radio gets
hot</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">The radio and power supply should be on the shelf above
the work area because with the telephone and radio, there is no space left
on the desk top</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Intermod on 2 meters is very evident in the EOC, making
it difficult to monitor a radio while wearing headphones. Testing using
the small Digital Communications intermod filter was not successful, so
the larger filter will be tested to see if it would make the use of 2 meters
acceptable</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">One duplex receptacle near the floor for each operator
position is not enough. Installing a power bar would allow for a computer,
battery charger or other devices to be plugged in with minimal effort</font></li>
</ul>

</ul>

<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">Space in the EOC communications room was also a
problem, with only one of the four EMRG positions available for EMRG use.
If EMRG was called in, something would have been worked out, but this is
worth exploring in advance.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">With the limited space in the communications room
it may be beneficial to have some space for EMRG outside of the EOC. This
could be an office which EMRG could use for limited radio communications
and coordination, allowing only the required radio operators in the communications
room.</font></dir>

<b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>7.0 AMATEUR RADIO OVERVIEW</font></font></b>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Amateur radio operators come from all walks of life
and get involved in amateur radio for many reasons</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Amateur radio operators are licensed by Industry Canada
(IC) and use frequencies reserved for amateur radio</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">In an emergency, amateur radio operators can provide
skilled radio operators, radio equipment and transportation</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<b><font face="Arial">7.1 WHAT IS AMATEUR RADIO</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">Hams, as amateur radio operators are called, get
involved in Amateur Radio for many reasons. They all have in common a basic
knowledge of radio technology, regulations, and operating principles, demonstrated
by passing an examination for a license to operate on radio frequencies
known as the Amateur Bands. These frequencies are reserved by Industry
Canada (formerly the federal Department of Communications, or DOC), for
use by Hams.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Amateur Radio operators come from all walks of life
-- movie stars, missionaries, doctors, students, politicians, truck drivers,
and just plain folks! They are all ages, sexes, income levels, and nationalities,
have an interest in what's happening in the world and use radio to reach
out.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Some Hams are attracted by the ability to communicate
across the country, around the globe, even with astronauts on space missions.
Others build and experiment with electronics. Those with a competitive
streak enjoy DX contests, where the object is to see how many distant locations
they can contact. Some like the convenience of a technology that gives
them portable communication. Others use it to open the door to new friendships
over the air or through participation in one of more than 2000 Amateur
Radio clubs throughout the world.</font>

</dir>
<b><font face="Arial">7.2 WHAT CAN AMATEUR RADIO PROVIDE</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">Amateur radio operators are equipped with hand
held, mobile and base station radios, which they own &amp; operate at their
own expense. The equipment forms the basis for a hobby which has a long
history of community service.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The repeater network which forms the backbone of
amateur communications, is owned and operated by local amateur radio clubs
or interest groups in the area. These clubs establish and maintain this
equipment as part of the amateur radio hobby and for public service work.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In an emergency, amateur radio operators can provide:</font></dir>
</dir>

<ol>
<dir>
<dir>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial"><b>Skilled radio operators</b>. They know how to use
the radio, they use it every day!</font></li>

<li VALUE="1">
<font face="Arial"><b>Radio Equipment</b>. Members already have the radios
and they know they are working because they are used every day!</font></li>

<li VALUE="1">
<font face="Arial"><b>Transportation</b>. Members have vehicles for transportation
and many vehicles are equipped with mobile radios, making them portable
communications centres.</font></li>
</ol>
</dir>
</dir>
</ol>

<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">Some amateurs hold a valid Restricted Operators
Certificate (ROC) &amp; an Amateur Radio license. The ROC provides licensed
operation of commercial Land mobile, Air &amp; Marine radios.</font></dir>
</dir>

<ul>
<dir>
<dir>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">This provides a resource of trained &amp; licensed radio
operators who can operate equipment belonging to primary agencies if required</font></li>
</ul>
</dir>
</dir>
</ul>

<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">Many amateurs are involved in electronics or communications
professionally, providing tools and expertise which can prove very useful
in an emergency.</font></dir>
</dir>
<b><font face="Arial">7.3 AMATEUR RADIO RESOURCES AVAILABLE</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">Amateur radio resources available for emergency
use are made up of three main components:</font></dir>
</dir>

<ol>
<dir>
<dir>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Amateur radio operators with radios in their homes,
in their cars and/or hand held radios</font></li>

<li VALUE="1">
<font face="Arial">Distributed repeaters<sup>(1)</sup> serving the area
with each repeater having a different physical location, height and power</font></li>

<li VALUE="1">
<font face="Arial">Cooperation among operators to pass information between
operators or between different radio networks</font></li>
</ol>
</dir>
</dir>
</ol>

<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial"><sup>(1)</sup>The design and location of a repeater
is based on the resources available to the group that built it and the
community of interest that the repeater is meant to serve. For Example
the Pioneer Amateur Radio club has access to Bell Canada radio sites and
designed their repeater to provide good coverage over a wide area. The
repeater is made up of three receiving sites (Kanata, Bank St. and Cumberland)
with one transmitter in the middle (160 Elgin street).</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Other groups have affiliation with local radio/TV
stations, the RCMP and some are just local people using their own resources.
The Manotick repeater is an example of a design meant to serve a local
need in the Manotick-Kemptville area.</font>

is based on the increasing number of people without power, and the increasing
number of trees falling on power lines and trees. This is the first time
in Regional history that we have taken this step.</font></dir>
</dir>
<font face="Arial">We ask everyone to stay where they are if they are in
a safe place.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Community centres are open throughout the Region

<p><b><font face="Arial">8.2 CBC REPORT: Posted Jan 09, 1998 01:55 PM EST</font></b>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">The worst ice storm in Quebec in almost 40 years
turned even uglier Thursday. Freezing rain continued to lash the province,
as well as eastern Ontario before heading into the Maritimes. Seven people
are dead as a result of the storm which has left more than three million
people without electricity.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The storm began Tuesday, dumping 45 millimetres of
freezing rain around Montreal. Another 25 millimetres are expected over
the Next few days.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The arrival of 2,500 Canadian Forces troops in the
Montreal area on Thursday capped a day that began with many people waking
to the sound of exploding overloaded power transformers.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Emergency crews were kept hopping in Quebec and Ontario
as they responded to reports of trees pulling down power lines, prompting
the evacuation of several residences.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Hydro-Quebec reported that more than one million
Quebec households were without power as of Thursday evening. That figure
translates into an estimated three million people.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The worst of the devastation stretches more than
300 kilometres from the area around Ottawa, through Montreal to Drummondville,
Quebec.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Since the ice storm began, more than 100 cases of
carbon monoxide inhalation have been reported, mostly on Montreal's south
shore, as people tried to heat their homes with camp stoves and other devices.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The troops will be used to reinforce weary Hydro-Quebec
workers and municipal crews trying to cope with debris from the storm,
which battered the Ottawa area and forced authorities Thursday to declare
a state of emergency.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In the Maritimes, schools were closed in several
regions and hydro crews battled to clear overhead lines of ice.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Bordering states also felt the storm's wrath. At
least 205,000 customers lost electricity in Maine, nearly 100,000 in upstate
New York, 33,000 in New Hampshire and 10,000 in Vermont.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Prime Minister Jean Chretien discussed federal aid
for stricken areas of Quebec and Ontario. Chretien also said he would delay
by a day the start of the Team Canada trade trip to South America that
was to begin Saturday.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Via Rail was also forced to interrupt service on
most of its trains in Quebec and eastern Ontario.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Between 50,000 and 60,000 customers in the Ottawa-Carleton
region were without electricity Thursday and the number grew as trees,
weighed down by thick ice, tore down power lines and closed city streets.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Floods also hit parts of the United States, forcing
residents from their homes, closing highways and damaging homes. The flooding
claimed several lives.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Premier Lucien Bouchard said that besides the power
outages, one of the biggest problems facing relief workers was providing
enough shelters for people forced from their homes.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The premier described the storm conditions as unprecedented
and said they require the most rigorous emergency measures.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">"If there is a real cold tomorrow (Friday) and the
next night, it's obvious that we will have to provide people with a lot
of shelter," said Bouchard, who had to move into a hotel with his family
after power went out at his Montreal home.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">He said about 1,000 people had taken advantage of
emergency shelters by Thursday but "it might increase to 5,000 or 6,000."</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Hospitals have also been swamped with people suffering
from a variety of ailments such as fractures from slipping on treacherous
sidewalks.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Some shelters were also being hit by blackouts, as
were hotels and Canadian Forces armories.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The Armed Forces supplied about 8,000 cots to the
Red Cross before troops were called in. The soldiers have been using hovercraft
to break up ice on area rivers.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Their main mission now will be to assist Hydro-Quebec
and public works crews. Quebec Hydro has 3,300 technicians working around
the clock to restore electricity, primarily in the Montreal area and eastern
townships.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">It's expected things won't be close to normal until
early next week at the earliest. The freezing rain continues in many regions
and is expected to be followed by cold temperatures.</font></dir>

<dir><font face="Arial">Eastern Ice Storm Tuesday 06 January to Thursday
22 January 16:00</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">TELEPHONE LINES:</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">The number of telephone lines out of service went
from 100,000 lines (January 6) to approx: 20,000 lines (January 22). 80%
of telephone line failures were due to lack of hydro power. Telephone switches
are fed by hydro power. If there is a hydro failure, those switches are
able to continue their operation using batteries. After approx. four hours
without hydro power the batteries go down and need to be recharged. Once
a switch battery is drained a generator is requested to maintain the switch
operational.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">On January 12, 950,000 telephone lines were operating
on generator power.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">5,000 telephone poles went down during the ice storm,
300 to 500 KM of cable and 600Km of service cable "drops" to homes had
to be replaced. Between 1500 and 2000 Bell Canada workers on duty in Qubec
and Ontario. Support was received from Qubec Telephone, NBTel, Island Tel,
MT&amp;T and MTS. USA companies are on standby.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Bell Canada advised that the telephone network should
be completely restored by Monday 19 January except for the Ice Triangle
(South of Montreal) and a few rural areas in Ontario.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">CELLULAR AND PCS /SYSTEMS</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">Bell Mobility and Cantel reported their respective
network operating in good condition. Many additional channels were added
to the normal network to avoid overload situations.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Most of the cellular and PCS cells did operate on
generators in affected areas. The systems lost many cells however were
always operational.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In Montreal, DND operated using the Clearnet PCS
system. The PCS system is digital and secure.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">STOLEN GENERATORS:</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">Major problem for the telephone and cellular companies:
in Ontario, 50 generators were stolen from Bell Canada. One person has
been assigned to help the telecommunications companies. In Quebec, Industry
Canada had the support of the "Suret du Quebec" and from DND (Via the Provincial
