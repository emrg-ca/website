Ottawa-Carleton</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial">This newsletter has been sent to all licensed amateur
radio operators in Ottawa-Carleton. The list was created using the Industry
Canada database, sorted by postal code, which extends outside Ottawa-Carleton
in some places. The purpose of this newsletter is to update the almost
1700 licensed amateurs in this region about the changes and improvements
that have taken place in the Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG), also
known as Ottawa-Carleton ARES.</font>

<p><font face="Arial">In the past 5 years, there has been a lot change
in local government, local employment and local emergency radio communications
in Ottawa-Carleton. With restructuring starting this year, change will
continue.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Many amateurs are not aware of opportunities to become
involved in emergency radio communications, while others became disenchanted
at various points over the past 5 years.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The purpose of this newsletter, is to ensure that
every amateur in Ottawa-Carleton has the opportunity to find out about
EMRG and what has been happening.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">I ask each person that receives this letter, to take
the time to read it and discuss it with other amateurs in the area. Remember,
EMRG is about volunteering to help your family, friends, neighbors and
community. This should not be a political decision.</font>

<p><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>WHAT IS EMRG</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial">The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) is a non
partisan group with no direct affiliations to any club. EMRG is not a club
itself, is not incorporated and owns no equipment. EMRG is a group of volunteers
who provide organization and training and acts as the interface between
the volunteer radio community in Ottawa-Carleton and the people we serve.
It is through EMRG that local communities, the Region, Hospitals and the
Red Cross, would contact local radio operators for assistance in an emergency.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>HISTORY</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial">The role of volunteer radio communications in Ottawa-Carleton,
began back in the 1950s &amp; early 60s. EMO was set up at the national,
provincial and municipal levels. Equipment was put in place for emergency
use, to link agencies within a municipality and to link municipalities.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In 1963 the XM49 Emergency Radio Squadron (XM49ers)
was enlisted by the local EMO coordinator as a way to expand the base of
radio operators in the event of an emergency. EMO provided courses in First
Aid and CPR as well as training exercises. In 1966 the XM49ers assisted
during the Heron Road bridge collapse.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In 1980, amateur radio VHF repeaters were available
in Ottawa-Carleton and a group was formed called the Emergency Measures
Amateur Radio Group (EMARG). This expanded the base of radio operators
in the Region and provided communications using repeaters.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In 1988 the Cumberland Township placed an advertisement
in the local Orleans weekly newspaper, requesting help from the amateur
radio population, to back up their communication system at the Fire Hall.
This advertisement was answered by VE3XL, Ric Guidone, and the process
of forming a core of volunteers was begun VE3CER was chosen as the callsign
and the Cumberland Emergency Radio Group (CERG ) was created.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In 1990, the present organization, the Emergency
Measures Radio Group (EMRG) was formed. EMRG brought the Amateur Radio
operators and the XM49 Emergency Radio Squadron under one volunteer radio
group. Members operate their respective equipment and on the appropriately
licensed frequencies. Many members of the XM49 Emergency Radio Squadron
are also have an Amateur license.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In 1998, after the ice storm, local amateurs in Osgoode
Township, got together to form an ARES group to serve their community.</font>

at:</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1><a href="http://www.emrg.ca">www.emrg.ca</a></font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial">The purpose of the web site is to share information
about EMRG, emergency communications in Ottawa-Carleton and emergency preparation
in general.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Arial">It takes more than a group of individuals who
own radios</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial">to be useful in an emergency. It takes an organized
team!</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>EMRG The Last 5 Years</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><u><font face="Arial">Joe MacPherson Resigns</font></u></b>
<p><font face="Arial">Many local amateurs knew Joe MacPherson (Formerly
VE3CAT), long time leader for EMRG. Joe brought in many training sessions
and exercises during his time, but in late 1995, Joe suddenly resigned
over differences with the Regions Emergency Measures Unit.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Following Joe’s resignation rumors spread that the
Region didn’t want anything to do with amateur radio and that they had
removed all amateur radios and antennas from their building. Rumors are
easy to start but hard to stop. The radios and antennas are still in place
and are being improved.</font>
<p><b><u><font face="Arial">New Team Leader</font></u></b>
<p><font face="Arial">In January 1996, Peter Gamble took on the task of
meeting with the Region to find out what was happening. Peter continued
in this role, eventually becoming the new team leader. Most of 1996 was
spent working with the Region and within EMRG, to develop a common understanding
of where EMRG fit into the Region’s emergency plan and developing a formal
agreement.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The year 1997 passed with no major changes. EMRG
met several times, but nothing was happening. Peter Gamble, team leader,
was learning that it takes a lot of skill and work to lead a group like
EMRG. People don’t tend to volunteer.</font>
<p><b><u><font face="Arial">The Ice Storm</font></u></b>
<p><font face="Arial">In 1998 the ice storm hit. When EMRG was not activated
as part of the ice storm emergency response, many believed this was confirmation
that the Region did not care. While EMRG was not active as a group, many
EMRG members were busy.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The main thing learned from the ice storm, is the
need to have a direct working relationship with local municipalities. It
was the local Municipality that was responsible for local response to the
emergency and if they did not know about EMRG or amateur radio, they did
not think of EMRG as a solution and so did not ask for assistance.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The review after the ice storm made it clear that
EMRG had some issues to deal with. Some people wanted to fold EMRG, but
they had no alternative. However Peter Gamble and some dedicated members
believed that it was better to fix the problems than to bail out.</font>
<p><b><u><font face="Arial">The Latest Chapter</font></u></b>
<p><font face="Arial">For the past two years, EMRG has suffered "chicken
&amp; egg" syndrome with respect to retaining and attracting members. People
did not want to be involved in a group that they feel is not recognized,
but it is difficult to become recognized without members. Despite the membership
challenges, there have been a lot of positive changes and a lot of organizational
activity in the past two years.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Local Municipalities, Fire Departments, Police, Hospitals
and the Red Cross, now recognize EMRG and expect to see members in to operate
from their location. Amateur stations have been installed in several fire
stations and more permanent installations are being planned.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The final phase for EMRG is to attract new members.
People who can be active participants and people who can take ownership
of activities such as organizing exercises, coordinating construction parties
and testing out new locations.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>CHANGES TO EMRG</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">The consensus after the ice storm, was that changes
&amp; improvements were critical to the continuation of EMRG.</font>
<p><b><u><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Four Improvements Identified</font></font></u></b>
<br><font face="Arial">&nbsp; 1) Clarify the relationship between the RMOC
and EMRG.</font>
<br><font face="Arial">&nbsp; 2) Become an active organization, not just
meetings.</font>
<br><font face="Arial">&nbsp; 3) Become known by, and involved in, the
local Municipal emergency</font>
<br><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; response community.</font>
<br><font face="Arial">&nbsp; 4) Clarify EMRGs role with the Red Cross.</font>
<p><b><u><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Making Changes</font></font></u></b>
<br><b>RMOC - EMRG Relationship</b>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">EMRG is an independent group of volunteer
radio operators. EMRG is not part of the RMOC.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">EMRG and the RMOC have a partnership, which
includes a signed agreement for EMRG to provide communications for the
Region in an emergency.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">EMRG is free to operate in any manner it chooses
and to provide assistance to any other groups or organizations that it
so chooses.</font></li>
</ul>
<b>Getting Active</b>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">EMRG has communications exercises and the
process is in place to ensure they continue with a minimum of 3 per year.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Repeater VA3EMV is now a portable repeater
on 145.490 -.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Training courses are being planned.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Local fire departments are interested in joint
exercises.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">EMRG is now the Amateur Radio Emergency Service
(ARES) group for Ottawa-Carleton.</font></li>
</ul>
<b>Getting Known</b>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">On January 20 1999, EMRG sent an information
package to all 11 Municipalities in Ottawa-Carleton. The information package
provided information on EMRG and the services we can provide in an emergency.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The information package was followed up with
face to face meetings.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The response from the Municipalities has been
fantastic!</font></li>
</ul>
<b>EMRG &amp; the Ottawa Red Cross</b>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Signed a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU)
on January 23, 1999. This provides the basis for ongoing work between the
two groups.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Now working on the details of how EMRG can
meet the needs of the Red Cross.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">These changes have happened and local municipalities
and the Red Cross are aware of EMRG and have expressed great interest.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>More Changes</font></font></u></b>
<p><font face="Arial">Now that there is a demand, we need to ensure that
EMRG has the resources to meet these needs. The next three changes have
started, but still have a lot of work to do. The three remaining changes
are:</font>
<br><font face="Arial">&nbsp; 1) Stimulate greater participation from the
existing membership.</font>
<br><font face="Arial">&nbsp; 2) Promote EMRG to the amateur community
to get new members.</font>
<br><font face="Arial">&nbsp; 3) Demonstrate a committed working team to
local municipalities</font>
<br><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through joint exercises.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>EMRG needs you as a member!</font></font>

<center>
<p><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>RECENT ACTIVITIES</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><u><font face="Arial">Gloucester Comms Room</font></u></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Gloucester fire department has made
available their training room at the fire station on the corner of Blair
and Innes, as an emergency radio communications room for EMRG. The room
comes complete with 3 operator positions, maps and white boards as well
as lots of table space. While the main intent is to serve the City of Gloucester,
the City is willing to make it available for EMRG to use in any emergency
anywhere in Ottawa-Carleton.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The initial installation is a VHF 4 bay
antenna mounted to the side of the tower at roof level, with a Kenwood
tri-band (144, 220 &amp; 440) radio. The plan is to install a second antenna,
which would be a tri-band for the Kenwood radio and connect a commercial
VHF radio with amateur and commercial frequencies to the existing antenna.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This site provides a key element that EMRG
was missing, which is space to operate net control and planning during
an emergency. The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) at Regional headquarters
does not have much space and is a very busy place. The EOC at the Region
will remain a key site, but the purpose of the radio link is to get information
into and out of the EOC. Long term goals for Gloucester include adding
a computer for packet &amp; APRS.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>911 Backup</u></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Region and local municipalities have
developed a 911 backup plan and EMRG is a key component. The plan would
be used in the event that phone service for 911 failed. If that happened,
announcements would be made directing people to flag down designated vehicles
to report any problems. EMRG would place radio operators at the 911 centre
and at the local dispatch centres across Ottawa-Carleton. If a problem
was reported to the Dispatcher, the EMRG operator would relay the message
to 911.</font>
<p><b><u>Hospitals</u></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The local hospitals are a key component
of emergency planning and EMRG is now a recognized resource. Operator positions
have been designated at the Civic, General and Queensway Carleton hospitals
(Working on the Montfort). Operation from these locations would require
a mix of external antennas and coax or portable repeaters.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Local Municipalities</u></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The response from local Municipalities
has been excellent. Through a concerted effort by EMRG, with help from
the Regions Emergency Measures Unit (EMU), EMRG has now made solid contact
with all the municipalities in Ottawa-Carleton, with the exception of Cumberland
and Osgoode, who have their own radio groups.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some of the items that have developed,
include local fire departments submitting budget requests for an amateur
radio and antenna, to be permanently installed at their main fire station,
testing radio operations from the Ottawa Fire Department dispatch centre
at Alta Vista and inclusion in emergency plans.</font>

<center><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>EMRG –The Future</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial">As the EMRG team leader for the past 4 years, I have
learned a lot about leadership and emergency planning. For the past year,
EMRG has become almost a full time job for me and I cannot keep up that
pace. This year, we need greater involvement of EMRG members and I need
to delegate more responsibilities to distribute the load.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">There are many activities that must take place this
year, if the Emergency Measures Radio Group is to be recognized as a serious
solution for emergency radio communications.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Many activities have been started, they just need
to be continued. For example, the EMRG call out structure was examined
and it was decided to use a zone based model. Each zone covers an area
with about 10 amateurs. There is a zone leader, responsible to keep up
their zones portion of the call out list and to make sure they regularly
test any permanent radio equipment in their zone.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">On March 5, there was a communications exercise to
test radio operation from the local fire stations that have permanent amateur
radio capabilities. More tests need to be done this year for 911, from
the hospitals, within each Municipality, with the Red Cross and between
multiple agencies.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Training is an important component of EMRG, because
we claim to provide trained volunteers. There is a small group working
on the initial operations courses, but more help is required. People are
needed to help write and teach specific modules of training and there is
always help required to coordinate the course times, places and participants.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Communications across an area as large as Ottawa-Carleton
takes more than some hand held radios and a few repeaters. What if repeaters
aren’t working (that does happen here). What if the objective is to send
information about 10,000 people who have been evacuated from their homes.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Amateur radio has much more than VHF/UHF communications
to offer. We need to look at these other communications methods and integrate
them into our "tool kit" of solutions. For example, many of the sites that
could require emergency communications do not have any way to install an
external antenna. The solution for these buildings may be a cross band
repeater located just outside the building.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Packet radio is an excellent means of sending data
using a computer. For emergency use, think of packet as the wireless "last
mile" link. Hang onto that old computer and TNC they can still be used.
APRS has a large group of users in Ottawa-Carleton, but how can it be used
in an emergency. There are people who have trackers that could be used
to locate key officials on the move, but who has them, who knows how to
use them. There is an ATV repeater in Ottawa, but not many people use it.
This is an option to provide information from an emergency scene, but to
the Emergency Operations Centre.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In order to be a useful solution, equipment must
be understood and tested by EMRG members and resources must be readily
available.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">This can be a great year for EMRG and amateur radio.
We need you to make it happen!</font>

<p><b><u><font face="Arial">SECONDARY COMMUNICATIONS</font></u></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The main purpose of volunteer radio groups,
is to establish a secondary communications infrastructure during an emergency.
The secondary communications infrastructure would provide communications
to:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Relieve primary agencies from message traffic
which is not of a critical nature.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Provide communications for agencies, field
workers or local citizen patrols, who do not have radio communications.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Link agencies which operate on different networks
such as Social Services, Hospitals &amp; Red Cross.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Link sites which do not normally require communications,
such as emergency shelters.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Assist in the event that primary communications
systems are degraded or disabled by the emergency or disaster</font></li>
</ul>

<center><b><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW</font></u></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Family safety and security comes first.
Make sure your own family is safe and secure before you leave.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Under Federal regulations, the contents
of messages handled by amateur radio are not to be divulged to unauthorized
persons and such public service communications are provided without compensation
of any kind.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All EMRG members shall comply with all
applicable laws, rules and regulations in the performance of the communication
services.</font>
<p><b><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">YOU ARE A VOLUNTEER</font></u></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Emergency radio groups are formed on their
own and volunteer their time and equipment to the local municipality to
provide radio communications in an emergency. The radio group is not an
auxiliary unit of the Municipality, available to be deployed on a moments
notice to provide any service requested.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Each radio group is responsible to operate
as a functional unit and to manage itself. Local Municipalities usually
know little about amateur radio and have little time, so they are not interested
in managing the radio group.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>INSURANCE</u></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Emergency radio communications volunteers,
must ensure that they and their equipment are covered by their personal
insurance. During an officially declared state of emergency, volunteers
are eligible for workers compensation.</font>

the Regional EOC on New Years eve as part of the Y2K operation.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Special thanks to the members who operated the net
and checked in, as well as local clubs (OVMRC, OARC, PARC &amp; CPC) who

<p><font face="Arial">A large, multi-club Field Day is shaping up for the
Capital Region this</font>
<br><font face="Arial">June 24 and 25. It's expected to be the largest
ever in the area and it has</font>
<br><font face="Arial">the potential to be the largest ever anywhere in
Field Day history, based</font>
<br><font face="Arial">on the possible number of transmitters and participants.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial">More than 100 participants are expected with stations
operating from 160</font>
<br><font face="Arial">metres through 2.5 GHz on all modes as VA3RAC. The
minimum target is Class</font>
<br><font face="Arial">12A but considerably more transmitters are expected
to be in operation.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial">The objectives for Field Day 2000 are:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">to have all Amateur Radio clubs and organizations in
the area participate;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">to be a joint effort by as many Radio Amateurs as possible;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">to operate a minimum of 12A and probably many more transmitters;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">to provide publicity and raise the public profile of
Amateur Radio.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">above all, for everyone to have fun!</font></li>
</ul>

<p><br><font face="Arial">Field Day 2000 is not a single-club or Ottawa-only
event but rather an undertaking with the cooperation and assistance of
any and all Amateur Radio clubs and Amateurs around the Capital Region
in Ontario and Qu&eacute;bec.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Arial">Many volunteers will be needed as station managers
and operators along with</font>
<br><font face="Arial">radios, antennas and equipment to make Field Day
2000 a truly memorable,</font>
<br><font face="Arial">record-setting, and non-partisan event.</font>

wishing to become involved</font>
