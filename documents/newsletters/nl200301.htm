<br><b><font size=+1>Team Leaders Message</font></b>
<br>Year end is a good time to reflect on accomplishments and plan for
the future.&nbsp; It has been a good year for EMRG, with some major accomplishments;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Emergency Preparedness Display
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Operation Integration Exercise
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Hospital Disaster Planning Conference
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Operations Centre
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Repeater 146.880
<p>The past year saw long term relationship building pay off and consistent
growth for us as a group. The future looks good, with lots of opportunities
to get involved in some projects as radio equipment&nbsp; becomes available
from Ottawa Fire Dept.
<br>If we keep up the good work, get more amateurs involved, we will be
ready for whatever happens.

<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font size=+1>DC Power Connectors</font></b>
<br>Ric, VE3IHI has been promoting and selling the PowerPole DC power connectors
to just about anyone who wants to buy. While each EMRG members gets one
free connector, additional connectors are available for $2.00 each. The
power connectors provide a standard interface between radios and power
sources. You can chew the insulation off the wires and twist them together
in an emergency, but why do that if planning ahead provides a better, quicker
solution.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b><font size=+1>EMRG Operations Centre Open</font></b>
<br>The new EMRG Operations Centre at Ottawa Fire Dispatch is now in service.
The room is about 10' x 12' and is dedicated to EMRG radio communications.
The initial installation provides radios on 144, 220 &amp; 440 MHz. Once
Ottawa Fire completes its migration to the EDACS system, then the EMRG
operations centre will be fully functional, including antennas on the Fire
Dept tower.
<p>The Operations Centre will be the hub for any EMRG emergency response.
Net control, deployment and planning will be managed from the Ops Centre.
There is a separate area to store equipment such as radios, power supplies
and antennas.
<br>The Operations Centre is part of the ongoing support from the City
of Ottawa to ensure that Amateur radio can be deployed effectively in an
emergency.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b><font size=+1>Emergency Preparedness</font></b>
<br>An organization’s ability to respond to disasters is directly related
to how prepared that organization is on the whole.
<br>Organization members go through different training courses.&nbsp; Groups
take part in exercises to utilize the training they have received.&nbsp;
All of this is with the intent to be prepared and effective, should a disaster
strike.
<p>When a crew comes on duty at the local fire station, they perform a
whole series of checks.&nbsp; They inspect their bunker gear, helmet, and
boots.&nbsp; The crews inspect the equipment in each of compartments on
the truck.&nbsp; Drivers check that the truck is full of gas and that the
pump has oil.&nbsp; This is all preparedness that allows them to depart
to a disaster knowing exactly what the state of readiness their equipment
is when they leave the station.&nbsp; The truck is ready to be deployed
the moment they arrive on scene.
<p>Imagine for a moment that this didn’t exist, that the hoses were still
in the hanger drying and no new hose had been put on the truck.&nbsp; What
if the pump’s oil reservoir hadn’t been filled after the last fire?&nbsp;
What if the truck ran out of gas on the way to the scene?&nbsp; What if
firefighters gear was all piled up on the floor of the locker room?&nbsp;
What if there wasn’t any water in the tank of the fire truck?&nbsp; Imagine
the time it would take for the truck to leave the station and arrive at
the scene if the firefighters had to get water into the truck get the pump
going and then deploy the hoses to put out the fire on your burning house.
<p>Preparedness starts with the individual and escalates to the various
levels of organization and government above you.
<br>The question is, how prepared are you, as a person and as a member
of the Emergency Measures Radio Group?&nbsp; The next exercise is intended
to assist you in being prepared to deploy should a disaster occur.

<br><b><font size=+2>Exercise "Ready, Set, Go"</font></b>
<br><b>January 18, 2003</b>
<p><b>Purpose of the Exercise:</b>
<br>The purpose of this exercise is to evaluate your level of personal
preparedness for deployment to a disaster.
<p><b>Scenario:</b>
<br>Emergency Measures Radio Group has been told that a disaster has disabled
all telecommunications (wire and cell phone) south and west of Ottawa.&nbsp;
Search and rescue teams are being deployed as part of a recovery effort
and food distribution and housing shelters are being established by the
Salvation Army and Red Cross.&nbsp; EMRG has been called in to deploy a
radio infrastructure to support those groups and to assist those in the
Search and Rescue.
<p>Operators will be deployed across three 8 hour shifts in varying capacities.&nbsp;
You don’t know where you will be deployed and/or if there will be electricity
where you are going. You’ve also been told that you’ll likely be deployed
for a 3 day period.&nbsp; Food and heat will be provided, however, car
access will not be possible to some areas.
<br>Each EMRG member is to report to the Ottawa Fire Training Center at
Industrial Road and St. Laurent Blvd. with your deployment kits where you
will receive deployment instructions and identification.
<p><b>What you need to do:</b>
<br>Bring everything you need with you to sustain yourself and operations
for a 3 day period, assuming you are being deployed on Jan 18 from the
meeting location.
<p><b>Evaluation:</b>
<br>There is no right or wrong here.
<br>The purpose is to learn what is needed by each of us as individuals
should a disaster strike.&nbsp; The exercise will help identify what each
of us is capable of so that each of us can improve ourselves as individuals
participating in a disaster.
<p>The details provided to the Emergency Measures Radio Group are limited
to the above, so make no assumptions about where you will be deployed or
what you will be doing other than it has to do with Radio Communications.

<br><b><font size=+1>146.880MHz VHF Back With EMRG</font></b>
<br>In the fall, EMRG applied to the Saint Lawrence Valley Repeater Council
(SLVRC) to have the VHF repeater frequency 146.880- assigned to EMRG. The
frequency was assigned to the Cumberland Emergency Radio Group (CERG),
which is no longer active.
<p>In 2003, the frequency will be activated in a series of Community VHF
repeaters, located across the City. Each repeater will use a unique CTCSS
tone pair so a single repeater can be used without bringing up all the
repeaters. In the event of an emergency, the nearest Community Repeater
can be used to provide radio coverage in the local area. The repeaters
would also be available for use by amateurs providing communications for
community events.
<p>For now, there is an operational repeater&nbsp; on this frequency, located
at Ottawa Fire Dispatch in Alta Vista.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b><font size=+1>Go Kit</font></b>
<br>Most people have already seen at least one “Go Kit” list that identifies
the material that each Amateur should have ready in case of an emergency.
Some lists go a bit overboard and include 16 radios, 2 vehicles and at
least 10,000 litres of fuel.
<br>There are lots of realistic things people can and should do to be prepared
for an emergency. Most of the things are simple, so here are a few to think
about;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Medications,&nbsp; snack food &amp; drinks
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Buy or build a cigarette lighter adapter cable for your
handheld radio.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can worry about power supplies or batteries
later. (you can always borrow these)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Build a simple &frac14; wave VHF antenna that can be
collapsed for easy transport.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See the EMRG web site; www.igs.net/~gamble/construction.htm&nbsp;&nbsp;
[I'll bring one of these to the meeting]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Buy 30 to 50’ of RG8X coax and two connectors. RG58
(small size) or RG8 (large size) coax can be used, but
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if you are buying new, RG8X has reasonable
loss and is mid size.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Need help installing connectors, let
us know, we'll find an Elmer to help]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Dedicate a cardboard box, cheap toolbox, old briefcase
or suitcase, to keep things in.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Throw in a few pens, pencils, paper, coins (how did
you plan to get pop out of a pop machine), map of Ottawa,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; masking, electrical and duct tape, string,
small rope, etc…
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Add more as you get ideas or money to spend. (Just a
hint, you will never finish this task, there is always
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something to add).
<p>Something, is better than nothing. Building a Go Kit is a journey, one
step at a time.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b><font size=+1>Simulated Emergency Test - SET</font></b>
<br>The SET is an annual communications exercise, which takes place each
fall, promoted by RAC through the ARES program. In Ontario, a specific
date is set each year for the SET and Local ARES groups in Ontario are
encouraged to have an exercise on that day and to use the National Traffic
System to send messages to other ARES groups.
<p>November 9 was the date for the ARES SET in 2002. This year the SET
was to be a joint ARES - Red Cross exercise, but delays and confusion produced
a Red Cross table top exercise in Ottawa with a few messages being sent
out on the NTS.
<br>The Ottawa Red Cross recognized that the exercise did not test the
ARES - Red Cross partnership, so they are interested in a local&nbsp; joint
exercise in the future.

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b><font size=+1>Email Newsletter</font></b>
<br>In an effort to limit the cost of distributing the EMRG newsletter,
we are looking at sending the newsletter via Email to as many people as
possible. For those who don't have email or wish to still receive a copy
by mail, this option will still be available.
<p>Using the email addresses provided in the membership, we will prepare
an email distribution list. We will send a short text only notice first,
so you have to option to opt out before we start sending the newsletter.
<br>If you have a preferred email address to use or you do not want the
newsletter emailed or you want a mailed copy, please let the membership
co-ordinator know.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b><font size=+1>MEMBERSHIP</font></b>
<br>The new membership system seems to have confused and annoyed some people,
so I’ll try to explain it one more time.
<br>The new membership system requires each and every member to send a
letter, email, or make a phone call, to the&nbsp; membership co-ordinator
once per year, in the fall (Sept/Oct). If the membership co-ordinator does
not hear from you, your name is moved to the next level of membership.
DO NOT ASSUME that because Tom &amp; Liz know you they should automatically
add you to the list. As team leader, I have to send in my notification
too.
<p>The changes were made, because in the past, I did NOT remove your name
from the membership list if you didn't fill out an updated form. The membership
list grew, but there were people on the list who had moved away or were
no longer interested in EMRG.
<p>The new system has three categories of membership;
<br><b>Active</b> - Participates as much as possible in training, meetings
and exercises.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Receives a copy of the newsletter.
<p><b>Inactive</b> - Interested in EMRG, but unable to participate in training,
meetings and exercises at this time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Receives a copy of the newsletter.
<p><b>Archive</b> - No longer interested or able to participate.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Does not receive a copy of the newsletter.
<p>You have the choice to be in any of the three categories. Send an email
or phone the membership co-ordinator to let them know which category you
wish to be in.
<p>If you were an <b>Active</b> member and the membership co-ordinator
does not hear from you after the yearly updates are requested in September-October,
your name will be moved to the <b>Inactive</b> list. If you were busy or
forgot, a simple note or phone call at any time will move your name back
to the active list.
<p>If you are on the <b>Inactive</b> list and the membership co-ordinator
does not hear from you after the yearly updates are requested in September-October,
your name will be moved to the <b>Archive</b> list. If you were busy or
forgot, a simple note or phone call at any time will move your name back
to the active or inactive list.
<p>Not sure which list you are on, send an email to Tom &amp; Liz. Remember,
we are all volunteers. If your name is not correct or is in the wrong list,
a simple note or phone call will do.

<br><b><font size=+1>Emergency Response</font></b>
<br>There is a lot of misunderstanding within the Amateur radio community
about roles and responsibilities regarding emergency response in Canada.
This often leads to anger and disappointment for Amateurs whose expectations
were not met.&nbsp; This article provides a quick view of where the responsibility
lies for Emergency Response.
<p>The simple answer is, It Starts With YOU, then your local Municipality.
If your local Town or City cannot cope with the emergency, they go to the
province for help, usually specifying what it is that they need help with.
The local Town or City remains in control.
<p>If the Province needs assistance, they will go to the Federal Government.
The local Town or City retains responsibility for and remains in control
of their areas. Federal or Provincial resources work through the local
Municipality.
<p>There are situations where Provincial or Federal emergencies occur and
these levels of Government can respond directly. The rules of engagement
and who pays are well documented in the various emergency acts and plans.
<p>If something happens to you, your family or your house, YOU, the person
or persons involved, are the first responder(s) who are in command and
must begin the emergency response.
<p>If your resources are overwhelmed by the emergency, such as you need
medical attention you cannot provide, your house is on fire or you are
being robbed, the emergency is escalated and the City of Ottawa first responders;
Police, Fire or Ambulance are called in.
<p>The simple explanation so far, is that when in trouble you must do what
you can to help yourself and if that is not enough, call 911.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>When the emergency affects more than you or your family, such as a forest
fire in your community, toxic smoke or a small flood, the City of Ottawa
takes charge.
<p>There can be a large scale emergency, without the need to declare a
state of emergency. If the City can handle the emergency with the resources
it has for Fire, Police etc, then they will not declare a state of emergency.
Declaring a state of emergency activates special powers for the City that
they don’t normally have and they must notify the Provincial Government
that there is a state of emergency declared.
<p>If the City needs more help, either money or special resources, they
can ask the Province for help. There is a process for this and there are
rules about who is responsible for what.
<p>The Federal Government cannot respond until they are asked to, by the
Provincial Government. The only time the rules change is under specific
circumstances where the Federal Government can declare a National state
of emergency.
<br>The Federal Government has a program to provide funding to help with
emergencies and can call on other government resources if required. Some
resources, such as the military may come with a bill for the Province or
City that requested them.
<p>Throughout an Emergency Response, there is official and unofficial assistance
and co-ordination.&nbsp; The Province would be aware of a large scale emergency
in Ottawa, even though a state of emergency had not been declared and they
were not asked for assistance.&nbsp; Provincial and Federal agencies may
be involved because of the type of emergency and such as an airplane crash
or chemical leak.
<p>Unlike the US, Emergency Response in Canada starts at the bottom and
works up. There is no Federal Emergency agency that takes over in a City
or Provincial emergency.
