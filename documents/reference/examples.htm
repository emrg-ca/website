Amateur Radio plays an important role in disaster response across North
America. Hurricanes, tornados, floods and winter storms are yearly
examples.
Two well known examples of Amateurs providing assistance, are the
September
11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre &amp; the Pentagon, as well
as the Columbia Space Shuttle Debris collection in Feb. 2003. This new
web page provides links to some of the related articles as well as some
comments on things to think about from the articles.
<p>There are news reports and articles which talk about Amateur radio
response
to disasters and these articles are intended to compliment the efforts
of the amateurs who volunteered. When we read these articles, we need
to
also look for the lessons learned, things that can be improved, and the
things that did not work or did not work well. There is always
something
to learn and we must always work at being better at what we do.

<p><b><font size="+1">NOTES:</font></b>
<br>
1) Lots of amateurs used in many places in many ways
<br>
There were many different groups of amateurs operating, supporting
different Government or volunteer organizations. Some people were
deployed
to support people in or near ground zero, but many were located in
neighbouring
states or across the country.
</p>
<p>2) Few if any amateurs were at Ground Zero
<br>
Years of training as a professional is not the same as getting an
amateur
radio license. Amateurs provide important communications links, but the
people in the middle of the disaster core, are the professionals.
Amateurs
work outside the core, supporting agencies who support workers in the
core
area.
</p>
<p>3) There were amateur communications issues
<br>
Not everyone could access the repeaters used for net control. In most
cases people worked something out, which is great, but each area should
think about their own areas of vulnerability and how to mitigate the
impacts
if a disaster occurred.
</p>
<p>4) Incredible radio coverage from a single site is devastating if it
fails
<br>
The World Trade Centre was an incredible radio site. There were over
98 antennas on the roof. The problem was that the great coverage meant
that additional smaller sites were not required. The loss of the one
site,
crippled many communications systems, which were later replaced with
systems
requiring 5 to 7 sites. Having a repeater with great coverage is an
asset,
but we must understand the impacts of losing that site and how to cope
without it.
</p>
<p>5) Have a problem and people will come, but how do you deal with
that
<br>
When people hear about a problem, they want to rush to help. However
more people is not always the answer, or getting the right people to
where
they
are needed takes a lot of organization. Resource management of a large
event is a task in itself. Planning in advance for how to manage
incoming
amateur volunteers is worth some thought.
</p>
<p>6) Large disaster sites have a lot of noise, audio and RF.
<br>
Each organization brings its radios to the disaster area. Depending
on the frequencies used, the RF noise in the amateur bands can
increase,
making it difficult to hear distant repeaters. Audio noise from
equipment
can make it difficult to hear the radio, regardless of the incoming
signal.
</p>
<p>The audio and RF noise in the area around the Pentagon was very
loud,
so it was hard to hear. The RF noise problem was overcome with a
portable
repeater, installed in the area.
