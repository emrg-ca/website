<div style="text-align: center;">Amateur Radio Emergency Communications<br>
</div>
<br>
Amateur radio is known around the world for its role in providing
communications in times of disaster. What many amateurs don't know is
that the groups, who were effective providing communications, prepared
and trained to be able to provide that high level of service.<br>
<br>
In Ottawa, the Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) is the local
Amateur radio emergency communications group. EMRG has partnerships
with the City of Ottawa, Ottawa Red Cross and the Hospitals, to provide
communications if required in an emergency or disaster.<br>
<br>
EMRG is part of the RAC Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) program.
ARES provides a common structure, which can be used to promote ARES
Federally and Provincially, as well as providing guidance to help new
groups get started. EMRG is Ottawa ARES, two names, one group, one
purpose.<br>
<br>
There are no special requirements to participate in EMRG, other than an
interest to help and a valid Amateur radio license. One of the purposes
of EMRG is to provide training and an opportunity for Amateurs to share
information, so new amateurs can participate effectively alongside long
time operators.<br>
<br>
Each EMRG member brings the equipment they can share in an emergency.
However some sites have permanent equipment installed and EMRG is
building a small supply of radios, so even Amateurs with a license but
no equipment can still play an important role.<br>
<br>
Some Amateurs believe that in an emergency, "lots" or amateurs will
come forward to help and good things will happen. It takes more than a
group of individuals who own radios to be useful in an emergency. It
takes an organized team. Like any team activity, practice ensures that
everyone is playing the game together and is working from the same game
plan. <br>
<br>
Knowing whom to call, who is in charge, where to go, what to take and
which frequency to use, are some of the reasons why it is important to
prepare before a disaster strikes. <br>
