Amateur radio has provided radio communications for many different
emergencies over the years. But it takes more than just an amateur
license to be useful and effective in an emergency.<br>
<br>
The fist step is being prepared. In an emergency, family comes first,
so if you prepared your home and family in advance, you will be
available to help others immediately. Emergency preparedness starts
with you. Create a home emergency plan and review it regularly with
your family. Include supplies for 3 days and plan alternate locations
where family can go, as well as a common contact location where family
can leave a message.<br>
<br>
Once your family is secure you are ready to go. But go where? If you
have not participated in emergency preparedness planning and training,
you probably don't know who to contact, what frequencies to use, who is
in charge or where to go at various sites. Simply "popping" into the
middle of an emergency can cause more grief for an already overworked
team. Many Amateur groups in North America will no longer accept
amateurs who are not trained in Emergency Communications. For example,
many amateurs who volunteered for 911 in New York, were told to go back
home because they lacked secure identification and had no training.<br>
<br>
So what if you want to help, but have no training and don't own more
than a portable radio. Is there any point in volunteering? Everyone has
to start somewhere, so an interested person with an amateur radio
license is a great place to start. In Ottawa, EMRG has meetings,
training sessions and exercises to help amateurs learn and practice
emergency communications. As for equipment, most locations require more
than one person, so the other person probably has enough, or someone
will lend you some. EMRG has been building up a stock of radios, power
supplies and antennas, for use in locations where people don't have the
required equipment. There are also locations which have a permanent
radio installed, so only the radio operator is required.<br>
<br>
The next step is up to you. If you believe in Amateur radio as a
valuable emergency communications resource, then you need to get
involved, so you can be an effective asset in an emergency. It takes
more than a group of people with radios to be effective in an
emergency, it takes an organized team!<br>
