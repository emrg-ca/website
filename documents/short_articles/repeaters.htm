Providing emergency communications as an Amateur radio volunteer is
about more than taking you and your radio out when there is a problem
in the community. Effective communications requires planning,
preparation and testing in advance, to understand weaknesses due to
terrain, equipment or skills. By understanding the potential obstacles
to good communications, technical solutions, training and exercises can
be developed in advance, to overcome those obstacles.<br>
<br>
Repeaters are an important part of EMRG&#8217;s emergency communications.
Effective communications in Ottawa requires a mix of Wide Area,
Regional and Community Repeaters. Ottawa is a large city, about 85 km
across (by air), so one or more Wide Area Repeaters are required to
link locations across the City. There are also communities within the
City, which tend to define a functional unit. Community Repeaters
provide coverage within these smaller functional units for local
citizen patrols or for linking sites of interest that do not need to be
linked as part of the City wide network.<br>
<br>
Regional repeaters provide additional capacity within communities, or
to link communities together or to central communications sites. The
Regional repeaters have greater coverage than a community repeater, but
not as much as a wide area repeater.<br>
<br>
Some ask &#8220;Why so many repeaters&#8221;, which is a good question. EMRG is
preparing for an unknown emergency, which has caused unknown damage.
Some or all of the repeaters may not be available. With enough repeater
infrastructure in place, there is a good chance that some of it will be
functional, to provide emergency communications. <br>
<br>
Ottawa has a large number of repeaters in place today and the repeater
owners willingly make their repeaters available in an emergency. EMRG
repeaters fill in the gaps.<br>
