<h1>Five Questions</h1>

<p>At the January 31, 2004 General Meeting, EMRG members were split into three groups,
with the task of answering five questions.
The purpose of this exercise was to find out what people in EMRG think about
EMRG and how we can make the group even better.
</p>

<p>This group exercise produced some excellent feedback, which will help the management team improve.
<br/>The main theme of the comments can be summed up as:
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">
"WE WANT TO BE MORE INVOLVED IN PLANNING AND BUILDING FOR EMRG!"
