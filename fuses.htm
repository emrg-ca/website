<h1>Fuses</h1>

<h2>Do I need a fuse on the negative wire to my radio?</h2>

<p>It won't hurt if you install a fuse on the negative lead,
and the wiring harness that ships with most Amateur mobiles has two fuses.
</p>

<p style="color: red;">
The fuse on the negative (ground) lead is only really required
on installations that connect directly to the vehicle battery.
</p>

<p>The reason for the fuse, is that if the vehicle grounding from the battery to the car
frame/engine should fail, either partially or completely, the radios negative lead
"ground", in some cases, become the return path to the battery for the vehicle, causing the wire to burn.
</p>

<p>This is not an issue for radios connected to power supplied,
the vehicle chassis, or batteries not in a vehicle.
</p>

<p style="color: red;">
ALWAYS FUSE THE POSITIVE LEAD!
