		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>EMRG has reached a crossroads, one that requires a step back, with an open mind, to define a plan for a sustainable future for EMRG. This is not a time of crisis or despair for EMRG. EMRG is not on the verge of collapse.
		</p>

		<p>EMRG has progressed significantly over the past <a href="IceStorm_TenYearsLater.ppt">10 years</a> and we have a clear understanding of EMRGs role and clients. We also understand that not all Amateurs are interested, or have the time to participate in EMRG, so while we need to continue to promote EMRG and recruit new members, there is no giant pool of members just waiting to be tapped.
		</p>

		<p>While EMRG appears stable, it is not sustainable. Our successes are the result of overworking a few people, mostly the management team, and they too have other interests and would like to see fresh energy and ideas in EMRG. Most importantly, we are failing to build client relationships at an operations level We are not walking the talk about what is really important.
