    <h2>Starting A Go Kit</h2>

    <p>The best place to start is at the very beginning and assume you will be using someone else's radio, or you will be at one of the locations that has a permanent radio. This avoids all the issues about what equipment to pack, which is a separate discussion in itself. The basic go kit can be put together for a few dollars and can be stored in a plastic bag, such as one of the stronger ones from a specialty store. If you have an old knapsack or carry bag, (or buy one at a low cost store), that is even better since it will have pockets and zippers.
    </p>

    <p>The basic go kit is the list of the items you need to be able to deploy to a location that is not very organized, so you don't get thirsty or too hungry and you can copy messages. The goal is to be prepared, so you can support yourself and not be a drain on local resources.
    </p>

    <p>The following is the minimum that you should maintain at the ready in case of a deployment. You can feel free to add other things that you see fit, but this is a starting point.
    </p>

    <h2>Small Personal First Aid Kit</h2>

    <p>The reason to pack a first aid kit, is so you can take care of
yourself. EMRG volunteers are not first-aiders, there are people who
will be assigned to this role. In the event that you have a headache,
cut your finger, etc, you want to be able to take care of yourself,
rather than taking up the time of the first-aiders who are busy with
the real victims. If you are not sure about your injury, then seek help.
    </p>

    <p>You can find basic first aid kits in most outdoor supply stores and
pharmacies. Some basic items to include in the first aid kit are:
    </p>

    <ul>

      <li>Aspirin plus Tylenol/Advil or similar pain relief items </li>
      <li>Antiseptic wipes, one or more clean bandages </li>
      <li>Band-Aids etc. for cuts, scrapes, or burns </li>
      <li>A roll or two of white, medical adhesive tape </li>
      <li>Scissors, tweezers, small pliers </li>
      <li>Safety pins. Several sizes of them are useful for many things. </li>
    </ul>
