<br>When dealing with local organizations such as hospitals, fire departments
or municipal emergency planners, regarding permanent radio installations,
there is always the question of what is required and how much will it cost.
For example a local fire department wants to have a permanent amateur radio
installation at a fire station.
<p>There are several options, depending on just how prepared an organization
wants to be. In discussions at a recent meeting, it was clear that everyone
has a different view of what should be done. This topic is meant to collect
information about the experiences of other groups across the country. What
worked, what didn't work and what things really don't matter. Typically
the goal is to find an antenna that is simple, long lasting and economical.
<p>Some of the questions are:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) What is a good all purpose
antenna for installation at a site
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such as
an EOC or fire station?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Should it be a dual band or
single band antenna?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Who should do the installation?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) Is height a good thing or a
bad thing?
<br>&nbsp;

<br>By far, the most popular antenna for a permanent emergency installation,
is the Sinclair 210-C. This is a very durable single loop VHF antenna which
covers 138 to 174 Mhz. There are other antennas in this family, the 210-C2
and 210-C4 are popular for commercial and repeater use. The wide bandwidth
capability, makes the antenna very appealing, because it can be used for
commercial and amateur frequencies.
<p>Dual band antennas are great for installations where operating two radios
on different nets is a requirement. In Ottawa, there are several Diamond
200A dual band and 3200A tri-band base antennas which have been installed
for over 6 years and they are still working well. Some people have reported
problems with dual band antennas failing early in there life, due to the
design and the affects of wind loading.
<p>When it comes to installation of the antennas there are three choices:
<br>1) Have the installation done by professionals. This will cost more
money for the agency paying for the antenna, but it resolves the issues
of liability. In many cases, the group paying for the radio already has
a commercial radio shop who does work on their existing antennas. The problem
with commercial companies, is that they don't always do a good job and
corrective action is often required later.
<br>2) Have the installation done by professionals, but ensure that your
radio group has someone knowledgeable involved to oversee the installation.
This helps to point out problems during the installation when then can
be corrected more easily.
<br>3) Have the local radio group install the antenna. Based on past history
and relationships, this may be an acceptable solution. Beware that there
are
liability issues, during the installation (what if you put a hole in the
roof)&nbsp; and once the antenna is installed (what is lightning starts
a fire).
<p>Antenna location is an important issue. Having the highest antenna may
not be a great idea, unless you have a radio with great intermod rejection
capability. The purpose of the antenna will help decide how high it needs
to be. Local repeater use may succeed well, with a simple antenna at roof
level.
