<p><b>BEING PREPARED</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Plan to be spontaneous.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; The key to being successful in an emergency is
PLANNING
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the time to start planning for an emergency
is NOW.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; In an emergency or a disaster, repeaters may not
be operational
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and AC power may be out.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Are you prepared to operate self&shy;sufficiently
for several hours or days?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Start an EMRG emergency kit.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It could be a box, kit bag, or
old briefcase.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an emergency you'll have the
basics in one spot.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Review your emergency kit and
add to it over time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't have to fill it up the
first time you use it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'll add to it as you get to
know what is needed.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; The following information is meant to get us thinking
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about what we have and what we need to have
ready
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within minutes if we are called to assist
in an emergency.
<hr WIDTH="100%"><b>Small Personal First Aid Kit</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Aspirin plus Tylenol/Advil or similar pain relief
items
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Antiseptic powder, one or more clean triangular
bandages
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Band-Aids etc. for cuts, scrapes, or burns
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; A roll or two of white, medical adhesive tape
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Scissors, tweezers, small pliers
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Safety pins. Several sizes of them are useful
for many things.
<p><b>Personal Writing Supplies</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Clipboard, preferably with a weatherproof cover
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Pens, pencils, and pencil sharpener
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Notepad and writing paper
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; EMRG memo forms.
<p><b>Required Radio Supplies</b>
<br><u>Handheld Radio</u>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Spare NiCad pack
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; AA battery holder
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; External batteries with adapter cords
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Power adapter for using the handheld in the car.
<br><u>Headphones</u>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are necessary for working in and
around noisy locations.
<p><b>General Radio Supplies</b>
<br><u>Antennas</u>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Build or buy spare antennas for an emergency.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Start with a simple 2 meter 1/4 wave mounted
on an inverted connector
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or try building a J-pole or roll-up
J-pole.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Over time, you can add antennas because
you want to have several spares,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or you've got or built better antennas,
or you need them for other bands.
<br><u>Antenna Support Structures</u>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Keep some pipe or other type of mast available.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; You can use a mast to mount an antenna
above local obstacles.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often this mast does not need to be
very high. Consider this fact: a 1/4 wave antenna
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mounted on top of a 10' high section
of mast will always outperform a rubber duckie.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; This mast can be a 5' length of pipe up
to an elaborate collapsing multisection mast.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Handyman's tip: A threaded electrical
pipe that is cut in the centre can be coupled together
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; makes an easy&shy;to&shy;carry 10' mast
section.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Also, three or four concrete blocks can
help to support the mast and keep it vertical.
<br><u>Batteries</u>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; They are needed for things such as AM/FM
radios, flashlights, handhelds or portables.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try to have Alkaline batteries on hand.
NiCads always discharge themselves over time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; If you have NiCads, pack a battery charger
to go along with them. Others may need it, too.
<br><u>Coax</u>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Keep a length of coax to go with the antenna;
about 20' to 30' is enough to start.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This length allows the antenna to be
outside and the operator to be inside ;-)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; If you get more coax later, you can add
it to your collection.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Also, an extra 50' to 100' of heavy coax
has its uses.
<p><b>Miscellaneous Operating Supplies</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Copy of radio licences
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Maps of the area
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Pocket knife
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Kleenex
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Electrical tape
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Duct tape; it's good for many things
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Handful of plastic wire ties/wraps
<p><b>Other TIPS</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Cary a spare set of car keys.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Keep your car's gas tank up on the (F)ull side
of half a tank.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gas stations may not be open or they may be
out of service in an emergency.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Use only the (LOW)est power levels required for
clean communication.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low power use extends battery life and reduces
interference with other radios in the area.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Label your belongings with your callsign, etc.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Labels helps people return your stuff to you
after an emergency has passed, i.e. coax.
