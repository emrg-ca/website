<p>The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG), which is located in the City of Ottawa,
is made up of <strong>trained, federally-licensed, radio operators</strong>, who have made a
commitment to volunteer their time and equipment in the event of an emergency.
</p>

<p>EMRG is a local volunteer radio organization, also known as <strong>Ottawa ARES</strong> (or Amateur Radio Emergency Service).
Two names, one group, one purpose.
</p>

<p>The main role for EMRG is to provide <strong>emergency radio communications</strong> for
humanitarian response organizations that do not have a radio system,
lack capacity on their system, or normally rely on regular phones and cell phones.

			The City of Ottawa has proposed a
			<a href="external_url.htm?http://ottawa.ca/residents/bylaw/zoning/bylaw/full_bylaw/">Draft Comprehensive Zoning By-law</a></dt>
			that is a set of regulations to control development in the City of Ottawa,
			and is ultimately intended to replace the 36 existing zoning by-laws carried over from
			the 11 former local municipalities amalgamated in 2001.
			The city has published
			<a href="external_url.htm?http://ottawa.ca/residents/bylaw/zoning/timelines_en.html">Project Timelines</a>
			and is holding
			<a href="external_url.htm?http://ottawa.ca/residents/bylaw/zoning/open_house_en.html">open houses</a>
			throughout the community to present the draft by-law, provide an opportunity for questions and gain residents feedback.
			Additional open houses may be held during the Fall.
			<p>
			EMRG has prepared a <a href="release0001.pdf">response</a> to sections of the new draft bylaws -- specifically
			<a href="external_url.htm?http://ottawa.ca/residents/bylaw/zoning/bylaw/full_bylaw/pt_02/access_use_en.html">Section 55 (Accessory Uses, Buildings and Structures)</a>,
			<a href="external_url.htm?http://ottawa.ca/residents/bylaw/zoning/bylaw/full_bylaw/pt_02/height_lmt_en.html">Section 64 (Permitted Projections Above the Height Limit)</a>,
			and,
			<a href="external_url.htm?http://ottawa.ca/residents/bylaw/zoning/bylaw/full_bylaw/pt_05/radio_en.html">Section 120 (Accessory Satellite Dish or Accessory Amateur Radio Antenna in Residential Zones)</a>,
			as they relate to Amateur Radio, antennas, and support structures.
