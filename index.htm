	It takes more than a group of individuals who own radios to be useful in an emergency --
	<br><b>It takes an organized team!</b>
</p>


<p>The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG), which is located in the City of Ottawa,
is made up of <strong>trained, federally-licensed, radio operators</strong>, who have made a
commitment to volunteer their time and equipment in the event of an emergency.
</p>

<p>EMRG is a local volunteer radio organization, also known as <strong>Ottawa ARES</strong> (or Amateur Radio Emergency Service).
Two names, one group, one purpose.
</p>

<p>The main role for EMRG is to provide <strong>emergency radio communications</strong> for
humanitarian response organizations that do not have a radio system,
lack capacity on their system, or normally rely on regular phones and cell phones.
