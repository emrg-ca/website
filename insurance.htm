<h1>Insurance</h1>


<h2><a name="Description"></a>Description</h2>

<p>I am the EC for Ottawa-Carleton and am interested in knowing how other
groups deal with the issues of insurance and liability. I am not sure if
this is more of a discussion item rather than a simple answer.
</p>

<p>In our case, we are not an incorporated entity. Individual members are
responsible to have sufficient insurance for themselves and their equipment
for all activities (exercises and emergencies). The only time members have
any protection (workers compensation) provided by their local municipality,
is under the Ontario Emergency Plans Act and this is only applicable if
an official state of emergency is declared. Declaring an official state
of emergency still does not cover loss of equipment.
</p>

<h2>QUESTIONS:</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Is this the same for other groups?</li>
	<li>Does incorporation provide the ability to have insurance which makes a difference?</li>
	<li>Has anyone looked at the liability of the EC if something goes wrong?</li>
</ol>

<p>Regards

<h2><a name="Response"></a>Response</h2>

<p>There have been several responses and it appears that this is a topic
that many people think about.
</p>

<p>Two specific comments were:</p>


<ul>

	<li>Glad to hear that you have the same concern re liabilities.</li>

	<li>Our local Amateur Radio club carries $1,000,000 liability but this only
	covers third parties.</li>

</ul>

<p>The question was raised about whether RAC has ever thought of purchasing
a group liability insurance policy for ARES groups participating in ARES
activities. The idea is that if we could get one policy for all Canadian
groups the cost/group might be insignificant.
</p>

<p>This was looked into several years ago and was not possible at the time.
Pierre Mainville, VA3PM, the Field Services Manager (FSM) for RAC has agreed
to look into the matter again.
