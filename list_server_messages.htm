<br/>Hello
</p>

<p>The following note appeared in the last EMRG newsletter. So far there have
been only 2 people who responded. If you are interested, I need to have a
note from you by January 16, 2006.
</p>

<p>*****************</p>

<p>It has been over a year since I was able to provide 4 Ah and 7 Ah gel cell
batteries for sale. I am currently taking names for anyone that would like
to get one or more batteries. The price will be $10.00 for 4 Ah and $15.00
for 7 Ah. These are new batteries, fresh out of the box.
</p>

<p>If you told me in the past that you wanted a battery please tell me again, I
am starting a new list.
</p>

<p>I will take the batteries to the January EMRG meeting. If you will not be at
the meeting send me a note or give me a call and we can work out a time and
place to make the exchange.

<h2>November 1, 2005</h2>

<p>======================================</p>

<p>Hello</p>

<p>Here are a few EMRG updates.</p>

<ol>

	<li>EMRG will not participate in the SET this year. We have some things we
	need to test this fall, but they are not all ready, so we will wait until
	they are ready.</li>

	<li>VHF repeater VA3OFS is operational in Barrhaven.
	It is still getting some work, so it is a bit deaf, but this will be corrected over the next couple
	weeks.</li>

	<li>On October 13, team leader Peter Gamble gave an hour long presentation about EMRG to the City of Ottawa
	Emergency Planning Working Group.
	This group has representatives from all the City departments. (More later)</li>

	<li>The next EMRG general meeting is on Saturday Jan 28 at the Ottawa Fire
	Training Centre on Industrial Ave. The EMRG management team is planning this
	meeting, so I get to take it easy. More information in the newsletter next
	month.</li>

	<li>The VE3TEL UHF repeater that was on Bank St, has been shut down by the
	Telephone Pioneers. They donated the repeater to EMRG and it has now been
	moved to Fire Dispatch. The equipment was installed in a relay rack a few
	weeks ago and the next step is to wire up the controller and get it back on
	the air as VE3OCE UHF.</li>

	<li>The Red Cross radio project is progressing. I am nearly finished building
	the cabinet. The cabinet had to be only 12" wide to fit in the space
	available, and must hold 5 radios, a TNC, a power supply and a battery. Each
	piece of equipment is on a sliding shelf, so it can be removed for repair or
	replacement easily. I designed and built the cabinet, but I will be getting
	others to do the wiring and help with the installation. (More later)</li>

	<li>We have had one evening work session at Randall, and we have more work planned.
	The projects have been delayed this fall due to the work on the items above.
	Most of the items above had to be done on some else's schedule, not ours.</li>

	<li>Tom Zink and Brad Smith have been doing some packet radio testing.
	Also the Prescott Russell ARES group has been testing.
	If you have a TNC, dig it out and give it a try on 145.030.
	The digipeater is VE3OCE and there are stations to connect to;
	VE3OCE-1, VE3BQP-7 and a Winlink Telpac node VE3BQP-1.</li>

</ol>

<p>====================================================================</p>




<p>That is all for now!

<h2>June 13, 2005</h2>
<p>The Emergency Measures Radio Group (Ottawa ARES) has activated a new
Community Repeater, VA3EMV/East, in the East end of Ottawa (former City of
Cumberland).
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="repeaters.htm">More</a>...
</p>

<h2>April 12, 2005</h2>

<p>There will be two sessions for Randall clean up, one this Saturday April 16 (9:00-12:00)
and the other Thursday April 21 (7:30-9:30). There is lots to do, so if you can make it
to one or the other or both, every bit helps.
</p>

<p>The location is Fire Dispatch on the corner of Randall Ave and Alta Vista Drive.
Dispatch is the round building behind the
fire station. You can park in the lot next to the church.
</p>

<p>When you arrive, wait and someone will come to the door to get you. The
intercom on the door is for normal Fire Dept visitors, and the dispatchers
may be busy, so we do not want to bother them. If you have a radio, we will
be monitoring VE3OCE 146.880 (-).
</p>

<p>This project involves emptying out cabinets of parts and equipment, sorting it,
putting parts in bins and equipment in boxes or back on the shelves.
If you plan to attend and have not notified me VE3BQP@RAC.CA, please do so now.
</p>

<h2>December 18, 2004</h2>
<p>Peter Gample signed a new 3 year agreement with the City of Ottawa this week, on behalf of EMRG.
The agreement is the same as before, regarding expectations and limitations of what EMRG provides.
There is a new portion of the agreement which will provide a one time cash transfer
to EMRG this year of $5000, with $1000 each year for the remaining 2 years of the agreement.
</p>

<p>This is good news for EMRG, allowing us to move forward with the projects we have been
talking about for the last year or two. The agreement is also signed by Steve Kanellakos,
Deputy City Manager for Community and Protective services. This agreement is a result of
the strong relationship we have with the City and their belief in, and support of, the
work we are doing.
</p>

<p>The EMRG management team is in the process of setting up a bank account for the money
and we have created a set of documents which define the rules on how money is managed and spent.
You can check out the documents on the EMRG web site at
</p>

<p><a href="library.htm#Official_documents">Official Documents</a>
</p>

<p>Look for Administration documents; 305 and 312, as well as forms; 510 and 511.</p>


<h2>December 7, 2004</h2>

<p>The EMRG standard radio Interface document (EMRG-210) has been updated
significantly based on local and outside feedback.
The latest copy is posted on the EMRG web site at:
<a href="EMRG-210_Standard_Radio_Interface.pdf">Standard Radio Interface</a>
or you can go to the EMRG home page at <a href="http://www.emrg.ca">http://www.emrg.ca</a>
and there is a link to the standardization section.
</p>

<p>The website now has a section dedicated to standardization, which
includes some preliminary ideas on building a standard user interface.
</p>

<p>Please take a look and let me know what you think, what can be
improved or just let me know you read the document.
</p>

<h2>November 28, 2004</h2>
<p>Richard-UNW and Mike-FFK plan to have a 2-3 hr "course" on net control and
repeater operations at Algonquin College on December 4th.
</p>

<p>All EMRG members, ski marathon folks,  and any others are invited.</p>

<p>
Room T130 has been booked from 10:00-13:00 on December 4th, 2004 at
Algonquin College.
</p>

<p>
Any questions can be directed to Richard.
</p>


<h2>November 26, 2004</h2>

<p>
In preparation for starting the EMRG projects to get equipment ready for use,
we need to determine how we will wire the equipment.
I have been working on a proposal for a standard interface which I spoke about
at the last general meeting. The draft proposal is now posted on the EMRG web site.
There is a link from the main page.  <a href="http://www.emrg.ca">http://www.emrg.ca</a>
</p>

<p>
Feel free to take a look and let me know your comments and ideas.
Once we finish the standard, we can wire equipment in preparation for various
projects such as cross-band repeaters, packet systems or user interfaces with
multiple headphone and microphone connections.
