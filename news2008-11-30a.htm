<h1>OARC Groundwave article - December 2008</h1>

<p>Written 2008-11-30 The full OARC Groundwave newsletter is available <a href="http://www.oarc.net/monthly/gw_2008-12.pdf">here</a>
</p>

<p>This is the first of a series of EMRG - Ottawa ARES Emergency Communications articles in the Groundwave, thanks to the continued support of the OARC. As much as possible I plan to keep the articles focused on emergency communications, rather than EMRG - Ottawa ARES specifically, to make them educational and interesting for all Amateurs.
</p>

<p>What is the value of groups like EMRG - Ottawa ARES?
</p>

<p>When it comes to Emergency Preparedness we expect our various levels of Government to have solid plans to deal with emergencies and disasters, and we expect them to include Amateur radio in those plans. RAC and the ARRL have concluded that the main potential for Amateur radio to demonstrate value in the eyes of government is through the service provided by Emergency Communications.
</p>

<p>Saying that Amateurs are great people and will do great things if called, is not something that a Municipality can write into their Emergency Plan. Emergency Planners are looking for organized groups that have contact information, understand what is required and have developed solutions to meet those needs. In other words, they are looking for dependability, reliability, and demonstrated sustainability, which is what EMRG provides for Amateurs in Ottawa.
</p>

<p>Like the general population, Amateurs want to help when an emergency or disaster happens. Unfortunately there is nothing in the Amateur licensing process that prepares Amateurs for emergencies. Without training, Amateurs do not understand their role, who is in charge, operating procedures or equipment operation. Some operating locations are in secure facilities, while shelters are filled with vulnerable people, many of them children. An emergency is not the time or place to send people who have unknown skills and backgrounds.
</p>

<p>EMRG will absorb some walk in volunteers in an emergency by partnering them with EMRG members, but the primary source of assistance in an emergency is Mutual Aid from neighbouring ARES groups.
</p>

<p>Amateur radio emergency communications is a team event. It takes a group of people planning, preparing, testing and practicing in order to deliver effective communications solutions. Providing that level of organization and activity takes a lot of people. You donâ€™t have to join EMRG - Ottawa ARES to help. You may be able to provide support for a task that needs an owner, or make a cash or equipment donation.
</p>

<p>The OARC is a great example of supporting EMRG, while not being part of EMRG. The club has stepped up their support with the donation of a TNC for EMRG Red Cross communications, plus other support such as this article in the Groundwave, prominently displaying the EMRG logo and offers to have an EMRG - Ottawa ARES component on the Capital City net.
</p>

<p>If you ever thought you might be interested in applying Amateur radio to emergency communications, now is the time to get involved. If you are one of the many people who enjoy the hobby, remember the contribution that EMRG members are making for the Ottawa community and Amateur radio as a hobby.
</p>

<p>Next Month: What skills and equipment are required for Emergency Communications?
