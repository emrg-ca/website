<h1>City of ottawa - emrg agreement signed</h1>

<p>Written 2008-12-02
</p>

<p>At the meeting on Saturday I mentioned that we will be signing a new agreement with the City of Ottawa, and today I actually signed the new agreement.
</p>

<p>This is a three year agreement with $2000 funding each year and a one year renewal option. The funding will allow us to get Internet access at OFS dispatch for our communications room as well as funding a battery replacement program and a new repeater for VA3EMV East.
</p>

<p>Our relationship with the City of Ottawa continues to support EMRG.
</p>

<p>Regards
<br/>Peter
