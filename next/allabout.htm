<h1>The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG)</h1>



<h2>Overview</h2>

The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) is made up of Federally
licensed radio operators, located in the Ottawa region, who have made a
commitment to volunteer their time &amp; equipment in the event of an
emergency. EMRG is a local volunteer radio organization, also known as
Ottawa <a href="ares.htm">ARES</a>
.
Two names, one group. one purpose.
<p>
The main role for EMRG (Ottawa ARES) is
to provide radio communications
in an emergency, to organizations involved in humanitarian response who
do not have a radio system, lack capacity on their system or who
normally rely on phones and cell phones. The three main humanitarian
response groups in Ottawa are the City of Ottawa Community Services
Department, Ottawa Red Cross and the Salvation Army. EMRG radio
communications would be used to link shelters, mobile care teams,
community patrols, the EOC and other key sites as part of the
humanitarian response.

<p>
The secondary role for EMRG (OTTAWA
ARES) in an emergency is to provide
a back up radio communications solution, if required, for the local
Hospitals existing emergency management radio system. (This is not the
Paramedic radio system)

<p>
EMRG is not a club, is not incorporated, and does not collect any
money. EMRG is a volunteer organization that acts as the
interface between
the Amateur radio community and organizations who need Amateur radio
communications in an Emergency or Disaster. In Ottawa, the City of
Ottawa Emergency
Measures Unit (EMU) would use EMRG to contact local
radio operators for assistance in an emergency.

<p>
EMRG provides a single point of contact to access the volunteer radio
operators in the area, as well as interfacing with neighbouring radio
groups. The following diagram shows the relationships that
exist in Ottawa. EMRG has direct relationships with the Ottawa Red
Cross and the Hospitals, as well as through the City of Ottawa EMU.

<h2>EMRG Interfaces In The Community</h2>

</a>


<p>
Communications for local events such as walk-a-thons, ski
races, soccer tournaments, etc, is provided by the local amateurs,
typically through one of the amateur radio clubs. EMRG is not involved
in these events directly because most clubs have a history of working
with specific events and the clubs draw from the same pool of local
amateurs to provide the communications. Public service communications
provides an excellent training opportunity for amateur radio operators
to perfect operational skills and develop equipment improvements. Many
EMRG members participate in these events, which is encouraged by EMRG
because it is an excellent learning opportunity.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Liase between volunteer radio operators and emergency/disaster
      planners within the City of Ottawa, the hospitals in Ottawa and
      the Ottawa branch of the Red Cross.</li>
  <li>Train radio operators with an interest in emergency
      communications.</li>
  <li>Coordinate with emergency radio groups in other areas, before and
      during an emergency.</li>
  <li>Test emergency facilities and procedures.</li>
</ul>

<p>

<h2>History of EMRG</h2>

The role of volunteer radio communications in Ottawa, began back in
the 1950s and early 60s. EMO was set up at the national, provincial
and municipal levels. Equipment was put in place for emergency use, to link
agencies within a municipality and to link municipalities.

<p>
In 1963 the XM49 Emergency Radio Squadron (XM49ers) was enlisted by
the local EMO coordinator for the Regional Municipality of
Ottawa-Carleton,
as a way to expand the base of radio operators in the event of an
emergency.
EMO provided courses in First Aid and CPR as well as training
exercises.
In 1966 the XM49ers assisted during the Heron Road bridge collapse.

<p>
The XM49ers were using General Radio Service (GRS) communications,
often referred to as CB. In 1973, they incorporated as a group and obtained a
private VHF radio frequency.

<p>
In 1980, amateur radio VHF repeaters were available in Ottawa and a
group was formed called the Emergency Measures Amateur Radio Group (EMARG).
This expanded the base of radio operators in the Region and provided
communications using repeaters.

<p>
In 1990, the present organization, the Emergency Measures Radio Group
(EMRG) was formed. EMRG brought the Amateur Radio operators and the XM49
Emergency Radio Squadron under one volunteer radio group. Today, all EMRG
members have an Amateur radio license.

<h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>

<h3>Radio Communicators</h3>

EMRG members are volunteer communications providers, not interpreters,
evaluators, or field commanders. The two main roles of members are:

<ol>
<li>At fixed locations, transmit
messages which have been given to them by partner agency
representatives, or to facilitate the partner
agency representatives talking directly over the
radio if required.</li>
<li>To work with or shadow field personnel to provide
radio communications back to a central area. In some cases, the radio operator may
also be the field person.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Secondary Communications</h3>

Assisting the humanitarian response effort is the Primary Role for
amateur radio in an emergency or disaster. Amateur radio communications
is critical for organizations such as Community Services, the Red Cross
and the Salvation Army, who do not have an alternative to wired or
wireless telephones. Amateur radio can provide multiple communications
networks linking organizations together, using base, mobile and
portable radios.

<p>
In an emergency, primary communications systems for most agencies such
as police and fire, will be operating at peak capacity. EMRGs role is
to establish a secondary communications infrastructure which will;

<ul>
  <li>Relieve primary agencies from message traffic which is not of a
critical nature to their respective functions.</li>
  <li>Provide communications for agencies, field workers or local
citizen patrols, who do not have any radio communications capability</li>
  <li>Link various agencies which operate on different networks such as
Social Services, Hospitals &amp; the Red Cross</li>
  <li>Communicate with areas which have lost normal communications
networks such as telephone</li>
  <li>Link sites which do not normally require communications, such as
emergency shelters</li>
  <li>Assist in the event that primary communications systems are
degraded or disabled by the emergency or disaster</li>
</ul>


<p>
Providing communications from a disaster site, within the City of
Ottawa or within the Province to support emergency management is not a
mandate for EMRG (Ottawa ARES). It is possible that EMRG (Ottawa
ARES) could be used to provide radio capacity for logistics support to
relieve pressure on other systems.

<p>
Providing backup communications for Public Safety radio systems is NOT
a mandate for EMRG (Ottawa ARES). If the City of Ottawa radio system
used by Police and Fire failed, or if the Provincial radio system used
by Paramedics failed, EMRG (Ottawa ARES) would assist as much as
possible. It must be understood that there are not sufficient Amateur
radios, radio operators, or radio infrastructure (repeaters) to support
more than a few key sites, which is significantly less than the several
thousand radios they normally use. This is why commercial radio systems
used for Public Safety, cost so much. They are built with redundancy
and extra capacity for Emergencies and Disasters.<br>

<h3>Areas of Operation</h3>
</b><br>
EMRG stations would typically operate from outside the emergency core
(inner perimeter) of a disaster site. The inner core would be limited
to primary response agencies such as fire, police and ambulance.

<p>
It is also unlikely that Amateur radio would operate at the disaster
perimeter, unless a specific communications capability is requested by
Police, Fire or Ambulance. There may be certain secondary organizations
that are at the disaster perimeter, supporting first responders, who
may require communications. One example may be the Salvation Army
providing food services. In the event that Amateur radio is required,
the radio operators would typically be operating from the facilities
they are supporting, rather than a separate Amateur radio
communications post.

<h3>Emergency Plans</h3>
</span><br>
The City Of Ottawa Emergency Plan identifies EMRG as a
communications resource and outlines the high level responsibilities
for EMRG. The EMRG plans provide the details of how EMRG will operate
to provide the required emergency communications.

<p>
Under Provincial Legislation, volunteers are protected by Workers
Compensation when assisting in a declared emergency.

<h3>Resources and Capabilities</h3>

<h4>MEMBER CAPABILITIES</h4>

Members of EMRG provide three key items in an Emergency:

<ol>
<li>Skilled radio operators. They know how to use the radio!</li>
<li>Radio Equipment. Members already have the radios!</li>
<li>Transportation. Members have vehicles for transportation
    and many vehicles are equipped with mobile radios,
    making them portable communications centres.</li>
</ol>

<p>
EMRG has some members who hold a valid Restricted Operators Certificate (ROC)
and an Amateur Radio license. The ROC provides licensed operation
of commercial Land mobile, Air and Marine radios.
This provides a resource of trained and licensed radio operators who
can operate equipment belonging to primary agencies if required.

<p>
Many amateurs are involved in electronics or communications personally
and/or professionally, providing tools and expertise, which can prove
very useful in an emergency.

<p>
Amateur radio has an extensive network of voice repeaters, digital
repeaters (computer communications via radio), a video repeater and individual
members with base, mobile and portable equipment, capable of local, regional,
national and global communications.

<h3>RADIO NETWORK</h3>

One major advantage of Amateur radio is the many frequencies
available for use. These frequencies are assigned in bands of
frequencies rather than as individual channels. These frequency bands
have differentadvantages such as local communications using VHF and UHF
or long distance using HF. EMRGs local communications is based on VHF
and UHF radios, similar to those used by fire, ambulance and other
services.

<p>
To improve coverage, amateur radio repeater sites with fixed
frequencies are used. It is also possible to operate without the
repeaters, which is important in an emergency where repeaters have
failed. Amateur radio operators have experience communicating without
repeaters using specialized antennas.

<p>
When establishing an emergency
communications network, EMRG can establish multiple local communication
networks, each with their own frequency. These
local networks can be linked together through a wide area
communications network on still another band or frequency.

<h3>Emergency Preparedness Display</h3>

On May 6 2002, three levels of Government came together as part of
Emergency Preparedness Week, with a display of various
emergency response agencies. The display included typical first
responders Police, Fire and Ambulance), as well as other agencies
such as the Red Cross, Salvation Army, Hospitals and of course, the
local volunteer radio group EMRG.
