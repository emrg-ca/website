<h2>What is ARES?</h2>
<i>(Copied -- from the
<a onClick="leavingEMRG();"  href="http://www.rac.ca/fieldorg/racares.htm">RAC Web Site</a>)</i>

<blockquote>
<em>
"ARES is composed of licensed radio amateurs who have
voluntarily registered their qualifications and equipment for
communications duty in the public service, when disaster strikes. Every
licensed radio amateur, whether or not a member of RAC or any other
local or regional organization, is eligible for membership in the
Amateur Radio Emergency Service. The only qualification is a sincere
desire to serve. The possession of emergency-powered equipment is
desirable, but not a requirement.

<p>
Emergency service activities in each RAC Section are under the
direction of the Section Emergency Coordinator (SEC), who is appointed
by the Section Manager (SM). The radio amateurs in each community
within the Section register their facilities with the local Emergency
Coordinator (EC), who is also appointed by the SM or SEC. In order to
provide better support, in areas where there are a large number of EC
appointments, the position of District Emergency Coordinator (DEC) is
appointed by the SM. Being RAC officers, these appointments must be RAC
members. However , as noted above, other members of a local ARES
organization need not be RAC members."

assistance. This could be Ottawa ARES asking for help, or one of our 4
