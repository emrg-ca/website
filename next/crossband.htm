<h1>Cross Band Repeat</h1>

<center><em>It sounds easy, but it's not always easy to do!</em></center>

<p>Cross band repeaters are an excellent tool for emergency
communications, to extend the range of repeaters for portables or
mobiles. With a cross band repeater outside a building, a portable
radio inside can have quality audio and the messages are not missed.
Add a small beam and the cross band repeater can be used to provide
local coverage on one band, while linking back into a remote repeater.
This can be used to get out of a low area or to cover greater distance.


<p>This can be the difference between getting the full
message "NO FIRE" or just getting the last word!


<h2>There are five important points to understand about cross band repeating.</h2>

<ol>

<li>ALL repeater users should count 1001, 1002, before talking, after they press the PTT switch.
    <br>You may not know that someone is using a cross-band repeater,
    but if they are, they will not hear the first part of your message,
    unless you wait 2 seconds after pressing the PTT switch before you talk.
    This allows time to bring up the regular repeater and for that repeater
    to bring up the cross-band repeater.
	<ul>
		<li>The 1001 provides time for your radio to transmit and bring up the repeater.</li>
		<li>The 1002 provides time for the repeater to bring up the cross band repeater.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>In bidirectional repeat, repeater tails will lock you out until the tail drops.
	<ul>
		<li>The cross band radio will not drop out until the repeater tail drops.</li>
		<li>Other users can slip in before the tail drops, keeping the person using cross band from getting in.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>Amateur radios are not designed for heavy use. Know how to set up your radio to minimize transmit power.
	<ul>
		<li>Look at ways to add extra cooling, such as a computer CPU fan</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>Use CTCSS to keep out intermod or other users on the same frequency.
	<ul>
		<li>Cross banding intermod is annoying and needlessly heats up the radio</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>PRACTICE - PRACTICE - PRACTICE. Most radios have cross band as an add on, but not a well designed feature.
	<ul>
		<li>Make sure your radio does repeat, that your audio is good and that you know how to set it up.</li>
	</ul>
</li>

</ol>
