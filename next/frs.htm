<h1>Family Radio Service</h1>

<h2>What Is Family Radio Service</h2>

Industry Canada has introduced the new <b>Family Radio Service</b>,
referred to as <b>FRS</b> for short. FRS is a radio frequency assignment,
that does not require a license, making it a popular solution for families.
There are many makes and models of radios available from single channel
to 14 channel.&nbsp; For more information about the Family Radio Service,
check out the following

Publication on FRS.</a>

<h2>Why Is FRS Important To Emergency Communications</h2>

Family Radio Service is important for emergency communications for
two reasons; 1) To provide communications for emergency response and 2)
To provide communications with people affected by the emergency.

<p>FRS does provide some possibilities for short range emergency communications.
This may be to communicate between rooms in an EOC, track people at an
emergency site, etc., without tying up other more powerful communications
bands and frequencies.

<p>If you are providing emergency communications, you should be prepared
to talk anyone who might have a radio. Common radios owned by the general
public, are CB, Marine and now Family Radio Service.&nbsp; If people own
FRS radios, they will turn to these radios for communications in an emergency.
It is important to know the frequencies, so you can monitor activity on
the FRS frequencies.

<p>While there are restrictions on transmission of signals on FRS, there
is nothing to stop you from listening with any radio capable of receiving
the assigned frequencies. This also allows the use of high gain external
antennas, allowing greater possibility of hearing someone if they call.

<p>For transmission, you will need a radio designed for FRS use. Not everyone
will need an FRS radio, but it is a good idea to have a few available if
required. One problem, is the lack of knowledge that the general public
will have about the radios. In an emergency, you can listen without any
CTCSS, so you can hear everyone, however the person in trouble may have
CTCSS enabled, so they will only hear you if you have the matching tone.

<h2>Details About FRS</h2>

There are rules about what can and cannot be done with an FRS radio.
The key requirements are:

<ul>

<li>Radios must have an equipment certification from Industry Canada (according
to Radio Standards Specification 210 (RSS-210), Low Power Licence-Exempt
Radio communication Devices (All Frequency Bands).</li>

<li>Output power is limited to 0.5 watt ERP.</li>

<li>Radios are not capable of interconnection to the telephone network.</li>

</ul>

There are 14 possible channels available for FRS. Most newer radios have
added CTCSS to allow up to 38 tones per channel to help weed out unwanted
signals. Some radios have only one channel, which is channel 1. This is
important to remember if you are monitoring for emergency reasons.

<h2>Frequency (MHz) and the FRS Channel Number</h2>

<pre>
462.5625 (1) 467.5625 (8)
462.5875 (2) 467.5875 (9)
462.6125 (3) 467.6125 (10)
462.6375 (4) 467.6375 (11)
462.6625 (5) 467.6625 (12)
462.6875 (6) 467.6875 (13)
462.7125 (7) 467.7125 (14)
</pre>

<p>Channel Spacing: 25 kHz

<h2>ISSUES WITH FRS</h2>

<ul>

<li>There are only 14 channels, in high density populations, it may be difficult
to find a clear channel.</li>

<li>Kids love these radios, which means lots of users with long conversations.</li>

<li>The anonymity and lack of policing, allows people to do lots of rude, disruptive
things when you are trying to use the radio.</li>

<li>While the 14 channels are assigned and common across all makes of radios,
the use of CTCSS, is not defined by standards. Compatibility between different
brands of radio can be difficult to sort out. In an emergency, the person
calling for help, may have CTCSS on, making communications possible only
if you know the correct tone.</li>

</ul>
