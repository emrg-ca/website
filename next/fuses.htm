<h2>Do I need a fuse on the negative wire to my radio?</h2>

It won't hurt if you install a fuse on the negative lead,
and the wiring harness that ships with most Amateur mobiles has two fuses.

<font color="red">
The fuse on the negative (ground) lead is only really required
on installations that connect directly to the vehicle battery.
</font>

<p>The reason for the fuse, is that if the vehicle grounding from the battery to the car
frame/engine should fail, either partially or completely, the radios negative lead
"ground", in some cases, become the return path to the battery for the vehicle, causing the wire to burn.

<p>This is not an issue for radios connected to power supplied,
the vehicle chassis, or batteries not in a vehicle.

<font color="red">
ALWAYS FUSE THE POSITIVE LEAD!
</font>
