The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) is made up of Federally licensed

commitment to volunteer their time & equipment in the event of an emergency.
EMRG is a local volunteer radio organization, also known as Ottawa ARES .
Two names, one group. one purpose.

The main role for EMRG is to provide radio communications in an emergency to
organizations involved in humanitarian response, who do not have a radio
system, lack capacity on their system or who normally rely on phones and
cell phones.
