  <dd>Like any activity, creating an effective team takes more than a group of people with a common interest and skills. Creating an effective communications team that can deploy quickly, providing communications solutions that work in their area, starts with the average amateur radio operator.</dd>

  <dt><A HREF="antennas.htm">Antenna Suggestions</A></dt>
  <dd>When dealing with local organizations such as hospitals, fire departments or municipal emergency planners, regarding permanent radio installations, there is always the question of what is required and how much will it cost. For example a local fire department wants to have a permanent amateur radio installation at a fire station. </dd>

  <dt><A HREF="antenna_mounts.htm">Antenna Mounting</A></dt>
  <dd>The materials we choose and the techniques we use to build things, are influenced by our experiences, tools and materials available. Plumbers naturally think of what they can do with different types of pipe, carpenters think about how to solve problems using wood and welders look to various metals when they want to make something. The following is a list of ideas that have been applied and why they were used. The plan is to get some pictures soon, to go with the descriptions. </dd>

  <dt><A HREF="cable.htm">Antenna Cable</A></dt>
  <dd>In dealing with local organizations regarding permanent installations, there is always the question of what is required. When it comes to cable for connecting to the antenna, a purest would calculate the losses associated with RG-213 versus 1/2 or 7/8 inch heliax and then compare the cost of more power and preamps versus changing the feeders to a lower loss variety. There are formulas and calculations, but what are some good "rules of thumb" that can be put to paper</dd>

  <dd>The simplest form of radio set up, uses the speaker in the radio. This can be improved for emergency use by adding headphones. But what happens when you need to add a person as a logger. You can use a Y cable for the headphones, but what if the two people have different levels of hearing. It would be nice to have separate volume controls for each person.  <p>See also: <A  onClick="leavingEMRG();" href="http://www.cs.aston.ac.uk/%7Ebestpj/cairo/">CAIRO The UK Solution</A></dd>

  <dd>Cross band repeaters are an excellent tool for emergency communications, to extend the range of repeaters for portables or mobiles. With a cross band repeater outside a building, a portable radio inside can have quality audio and the messages are not missed. Add a small beam and the cross band repeater can be used to provide local coverage on one band, while linking back into a remote repeater. This can be used to get out of a low area or to cover greater distance.                <p>See also: <A HREF="Dual_Band_Tech_Session.ppt">Dual Band Tech Session</A>, <a href="repeaters.htm">Repeaters</a></dd>

  <dt><A HREF="nvis_intro.htm">NVIS Introduction</A></dt>
  <dd>We usually think of HF as a long range communications solution which is impacted by sun spot activity, time of day and weather. To ensure somewhat reliable or consistent communications, beam antennas and amplifiers are required and even then there are no guarantees, some locations may hear but others will not. For shorter range communications we think of VHF/UHF mobile radios and repeaters. Depending on the repeater location, stations 100 km apart can communicate while mobile.  But what about situations where there is no repeater, repeaters have failed or the existing repeaters just don't link the two locations that need to communicate.</dd>

  <dt><A HREF="nvis_index.htm">NVIS Index</A></dt>
  <dd>Near Vertical Incident Skywave (NVIS) transmits radio signals almost straight up (80 to 90 degrees), where it is reflected back down to the receiving station. This achieves dependable local area High Frequency (HF) communications within an area with a radius up to about 500 kilometres using frequencies between 2 and 10 or 12 Megahertz.</dd>

  <dt><A HREF="nvis_emrg.htm">NVIS in EMRG</A></dt>
  <dd>The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG), also known as Ottawa ARES, provides communications for the City of Ottawa. From side to side or corner to corner, that is over 100 km, just within the City boundary. Since emergencies don't understand Municipal boundaries, it is possible that EMRG would need to communicate with neighbouring Municipalities or EMRG members may be assisting in a neighbouring Municipality, reliable medium range communications is important</dd>

  <dt><A HREF="nvis_testing.htm">NVIS Testing</A></dt>
  <dd>This page will be used to collect information about testing done by EMRG. The purpose is to bring together information about types of testing and the results to help others who may be interesting in using NVIS.</dd>

  <dt><A HREF="nvis_antennas.htm">NVIS Antennas</A></dt>
  <dd>For mobile use the choice seems to be a 16 ft whip, which is pulled down near the end, so it is parallel with the roof of the vehicle, making the signal go vertical. There are variations of this for permanent mobile antennas. It is recommended that the antenna be fully horizontal when not moving, if possible for best operation. </dd>

  <dt><A HREF="packet_fax.htm">Packet FAX</A></dt>
  <dd>One of the most common forms of information transfer is the FAX machine. Even for emergency communications, most organizations use FAX, either portable units in vehicles or as a way to transfer information between offices. The FAX is direct point to point, the information can be sent as is, no typing, there is instant feedback about whether your message is going through, it is relatively secure and the information output is in printed form. FAX or "sneaker net" may be the only way to get the information to another place. Try sending a hand sketched diagram over a voice network.</dd>

  <dt><A HREF="packet_index.htm">Packet Index</A></dt>
  <dd>The EMRG objective for Packet Radio is to build a dedicated emergency network within the City of Ottawa, to support communications between permanent and temporary emergency sites. The network must be simple to operate and easy to maintain. This will be a controlled network with limited users, designed to provide direct communications, from point to point.</dd>

  <dt><A HREF="packet_radio.htm">Packet Radio</A></dt>
  <dd>In an emergency, voice communications is great for short tactical messages, but it becomes painfully slow when moving larger amounts of information such as lists of names or supplies. In the 1980s, Amateurs were rapidly developing and deploying a technology that would be suitable for moving large amounts of text information, they called it Packet Radio.</dd>

  <dt><A HREF="packet_requirements.htm">Packet Requirements</A></dt>
  <dd>The Emergency Measures Radio Group is building a Packet Radio Network to support emergency communications between key sites such as the City of Ottawa Emergency Operations Centre, Ottawa Red Cross HQ and shelters. The network can be used by all amateurs when there is no emergency, however the network will be optimised for emergency use, not daily amateur use, which means there are no beacons, BBSs or Internet gateways, other than those directly operated by EMRG, so EMRG can turn them off in an emergency. </dd>

  <dt><A HREF="packet_vision.htm">Packet Long-Term Network Vision</A></dt>
  <dd>It is generally accepted that communications in an emergency will not be equal to what is normally available. System overload or failure, as well as the need to work from temporary centres will all reduce communications capacity and availability. To be effective, emergency communications must provide some portion of normal communications capabilities. Up to the 1970s, information was moved by telephone, radio or as a physical package (Paper mostly). The world had a limited number of computers and computer networking was not generally available. Amateur radio HF and VHF radio was sufficient to provide a useful emergency communications solution.</dd>

  <dt><A HREF="objectives.htm">Standards, Reasons To Develop</A></dt>
  <dd>The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) has collected a diverse selection of radios and radio equipment, such as TNCs, phone patches and repeater controllers. The equipment all works well and is used in different applications, depending on its capabilities. In some cases there are several of same model of radio, while in other cases there are only 1 or 2 of a particular model. Every make or model of radio, TNC, phone patch and controller, uses a different connector, or the same connector wired differently. In working with this variety of equipment, it became apparent that a universal connection is required to make it easier to bring equipment together and for rapid replacement in an emergency. The purpose of standards is to allow equipment to interface together using the same connections and protocols.</dd>

  <dt><A HREF="dc_wiring.htm">Standard 12 VDC Power Connector</A></dt>
  <dd>EMRG has selected a standard DC power connector that will be installed on all equipment used by EMRG. The purpose in standardizing on a connector is to allow any radio to work with any power supply, battery or DC adapter cable. </dd>

  <dt><A HREF="anderson_powerpole.htm">Standard Interfaces</A></dt>
  <dd>EMRG is developing a Standard Radio interface for connecting radios and other equipment, such as TNSs (Terminal Node Controllers), phone patches, and repeater controllers, together. This same radio interface can be used with a Standard User Interface, allowing multiple operators to share the same radio. </dd>

  <dt><A HREF="standard_radio_interface.htm">Standard Radio Interface</A></dt>
  <dd>The Standard Radio Interface provides a universal connector for interfacing radios and accessories together. The first phase is to define the connector and connector pin-out that to support physical interconnection. The next phase will define the electrical standards for each signal. <p>See also: <a href="EMRG-210_Standard_Radio_Interface.pdf">EMRG-210: Standard Radio Interface</a> <img SRC="shared/pdficon_small.GIF"></dd>

  <dd>In an emergency, primary communications systems for agencies such as police and fire will be operating at peak capacity. The secondary communications infrastructure established by the radio group will relieve primary agencies from message traffic which is not related to their respective functions. For example, if phones are out at a shelter, it is not efficient to post a first responder at the shelter just to provide communications to get blankets, water etc.</dd>
