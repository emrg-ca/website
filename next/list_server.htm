Welcome to the EMRG Amateur Radio Emergency Communications list server
web page. The list server address is; arec@igs.net.

<p>The intent of this site is to provide a common location for the sharing
of ideas and information related to providing volunteer emergency radio
communications.

<p>The list server provides a means to ask questions and for people to
respond with the solutions they have found to work or ideas that may be
useful. For items that provide a lot of feedback or require a permanent
location, the information will be collected and posted on the
<a href="construction.htm">Ideas, Projects and Suggestions</a>
page.

<p>The list is not moderated, so if you send a message to arec@igs.net,
<u>everyone who is subscribed to the list server</u>
will receive it. This site is meant to be useful, so there is
an expectation on all users to apply common sense. If you need a part for
your emergency repeater, or you have something to share for a moderate
donation, please feel free to send a note. However this is not a swap shop,
so please don't send a note to say you are selling your HF rig or other
equipment.

<p>Visitors are welcome. If you are not involved in volunteer emergency
radio communications but want to follow along, please feel free to join.
If you have an opinion on CW, licensing or other similar amateur issues,
please keep your thoughts to yourself.

<p>If you have comments or suggestions about this site, please send them
to ve3oce@rac.ca.
