<p><b><font size=+1>INTRODUCTION</font></b>
<br>I hope everyone had a good holiday season and is now ready to settle
in to enjoy the winter. The activities of EMRG have been slow in the past
few months, mostly due to my work commitments.
<p>In December, I had the opportunity to speak to the Ottawa Amateur Radio
Club (OARC) about EMRG. It is important that all local amateurs know about
EMRG, even if they don’t plan to join.
<p>I have been in contact with the RMOC regarding the role of EMRG in an
emergency. This news letter will talk about this and the emergency plans
that guide us.
<p>On a sad note, December ended with amateurs assisting in a search in
the Meech lake area. This has been making me think about what is required
to help ensure we have amateur volunteers who can survive and be useful
in all types of emergencies.
<p>I would like you to think about EMRG and some of the roles it could
play in Ottawa-Carleton.

<p>I started working on getting EMRG established on the internet some time
ago. The internet has been a very useful tool for me in tracking down information
related to emergency communications in Canada and around the world. Now
we can share our information with others.

<p><b><font size=+1>Ski Marathon: Feb 8 &amp; 9</font></b>
<br>Here is an opportunity to test those winter communication skills. This
year the route will go from Lachute to Montabello on Saturday and Montabello
to Gatineau on Sunday.
<p>If you are interested in helping out with this years marathon, please
contact Harrie Jones; Home: 739-9365&nbsp;&nbsp; Work: 738-2372

<br><b><font size=+1>EMRG DISPLAY DAY!</font></b>
<br>Display Day would be an opportunity to bring together a collection
of communications equipment and people in one place, to provide an opportunity
to view, discuss and get new ideas.
<p>Some initial thoughts:
<br>&nbsp;> One day (or morning) event
<br>&nbsp;> On a Saturday
<br>&nbsp;> During the spring time
<br>&nbsp;> EMRG members only (?)
<br>&nbsp;> Various radio communications equipment such as a Packet station,
ATV, repeater,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cross-band mobile repeater, cellular, assorted antennas,
battery power and more
<p>Display Day would provide an opportunity for people to view some of
the communications equipment they may not have seen and to ask a few questions.
<p>This would also be an opportunity for local officials to see EMRG and
some of the communications equipment available in an emergency.
<p>The next step is to form a group to organize this event. Details of
the type of event, size, list of displays etc. needs to be put together.
<p>If you are interested in working on this, or if you have an idea for
a display, please contact Ed Strange at the next meeting or give him a
call. 828-4804

<br><b><font size=+2>EMERGENCY PLANS</font></b>
<br>There are many plans in place for dealing with an emergency in Ottawa-Carleton.
The decision on which plan(s) to use depends on the nature of the emergency
and which agencies are involved.
<p>For the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton, the main plan is the
<font color="#FF0000"><u>Regional
Emergency Plan</u>.</font>
<p>“This plan has been formulated to assign responsibilities and to guide
the actions of key officials after the onset of an emergency.”
<p>The Regional Emergency Plan is 70 pages long and provides information
on the following:
<br>&nbsp;> When, Why &amp; How the plan can be activated
<br>&nbsp;> Key groups and positions along with their responsibilities.
<br>&nbsp;> Names and phone numbers of representatives for the key groups
and positions
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outlined on the plan
<br>&nbsp;> Listing of other related plans which provide greater detail
in specific areas
<p><b>Is EMRG In The Plan?</b>
<br>EMRG shows up in two spots in the present Regional Emergency Plan.
These two items are one page each and cover the broad responsibilities
and expectations of the two primary EMRG contacts: the Communications Officer
(Now called Team Leader) and the Field Representative.
<p>The following are quotes taken from the Regional Emergency Plan
<p><b>What is an Emergency?</b>
<br>Emergencies are defined as situations abnormally affecting the lives
and/or property of our society which, by their nature or magnitude, require
a coordinated response by a number of agencies, both governmental and private
under the authority of the appropriate elected official, as distinct from
routine operations carried out by agencies as normal day-to-day procedures,
e.g. fire fighting, police activities, normal hospital routine.
<p><b>When is the Regional Emergency Plan Activated?</b>
<br>&nbsp;> At the request of an area municipality
<br>&nbsp;> When two or more municipalities are affected by an emergency
<br>&nbsp;> At the discretion of the Regional Chair when Regional resources
are consumed in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such a manner as to place a strain on these resources
<br>&nbsp;> When Regional facilities are threatened
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><font size=+1>EMRG COMMUNICATIONS PLAN</font></b>
<br>The Regional Emergency Plan does not explain what EMRG is or how communications
will be provided. This detail is located in another plan called the EMRG
Communications Plan.

<p>EMRG’S ROLE IN AN EMERGENCY
<br>One of the key tasks for EMRG is to plan and train, in order to be
ready for an emergency. This raises the following question:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton
(RMOC) Emergency
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Measures Unit (EMU) expect of EMRG?
<p>I spoke with Harold Murphy, the EMU manager about this. The two key
points are:
<p><b>The EMU looks to EMRG as a flexible resource which can provide communications
from anywhere in the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton.</b>
<p><b>EMRG would be required when existing communications systems cannot
handle the load or if the existing communications systems should fail.</b>
<p>There are no specific designated sites in which EMRG would be expected
to operate, other than the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) which is located
at the RMOC building.
<p><b><font size=+1>EMRG’S NEXT STEP</font></b>
<br>EMRG can play an important role in shaping the future emergency planning
in Ottawa-Carleton.
<p>While the RMOC does not have specific sites designated for operation
by EMRG, there is a need for EMRG to identify any locations within the
Ottawa Carleton Region that can benefit from improvements in communications
capabilities. The 2m radio at the Kanata fire hall, provides an example
of an infrastructure that can be put in place to provide points of operation
that are local to an area around the region.
<p><b><font size=+1>BEYOND THE RMOC</font></b>
<br>The Emergency Measures Radio Group can do more than sit and wait for
the Emergency Measures Unit to call. There are other groups within Ottawa-Carleton
that can use the resources of radio operators.
<p>EMRG should be the focal point for any organization that requires the
assistance of radio operators for an Emergency. These organizations may
be within the Ottawa-Carleton area or could be neighboring radio groups
needing additional resources.

<p><b>MEMBER DATABASE</b>
<br>Yes there is a database and we are still getting it organized and up
to date.
<p>The final page of this newsletter is a membership form. Please fill
it out and drop it off at the next meeting, or mail it to the address shown
on the form.
<p>There are over 100 names on the membership list, but only 35 to 40 are
attendees at the meetings. We need to verify if the remaining names still
want to be members and if the member information is correct.&nbsp;
