<br><b><font size=+1>INTRODUCTION</font></b>
<br>The activities of EMRG have been slow in the past year, mostly due
to my work commitments and buying a house.
<p>By now most people have recovered to some degree from the ice storm.&nbsp;
This storm certainly affected a lot of people. This newsletter provides
some information about the ice storm and why EMRG was not involved officially.
(For more information, there is a <a href="stormreview98b.zip">report</a>
that I submitted to the RMOC, located on the EMRG web site)
<p>As most people may have noticed, the weekly net on Wednesday nights
has disappeared. Without willing net controllers, there are no nets. The
management team has a few openings, so think about it for the meeting.
We need increased membership participation if EMRG is to survive.
<p>I look forward to seeing you at the meeting.

<br>There are amateurs in the area, who were upset that the Emergency Measures
Radio Group (EMRG) was not called in by the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton
(RMOC) Emergency Measures Unit (EMU) to assist in the emergency.
<p><b><u>WHY EMRG WAS NOT CALLED</u></b>
<br>While the ice storm created a lot of activity and did stress communications
systems within the Region, at no time was the RMOC without communications
or without a solution to restore them.
<p>Based on the RMOC-EMRG agreement and the communications requirements
of the RMOC during the emergency, the RMOC did not have a communications
task for EMRG. Therefore EMRG was not called.
<p><b>It is important to understand that this does not mean that amateur
involvement was not happening or that more could not have been used. It
means that the RMOC had no internal need for additional communications
and no outside groups such as local municipalities or the Red Cross had
requested assistance with communications.</b>
<p>The next item shows the key sections of the RMOC - EMRG agreement regarding
EMRG’s role.
<p><b><u>RMOC-EMRG AGREEMENT</u></b>
<br>(Key sections)
<br>The RMOC and EMRG have a signed agreement which outlines the reasons
for the RMOC to call on EMRG and the capabilities that EMRG is expected
to supply. The two key sections relating to the RMOC use of EMRG are:
<p><b>SERVICES</b>
<br>1. In the event of an emergency within the meaning of the Emergency
Plans Act, R.S.O 1990, c.E.9
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (hereinafter referred to as “emergency”), as declared
by the RMOC, the EMRG may be called
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon to provide, to the best of its ability, radio
operators for the duration of the emergency for
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the purpose of providing back-up communications
services.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>RMOC RESPONSIBILITIES</b>
<br>12. Notification of an emergency shall be issued by the RMOC Environment
and Transportation
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commissioner or his authorized representative
to any one or more of the EMRG’s members
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identified on the contact list.
<p>13. The RMOC is not obliged to utilize the back-up communication services
of EMRG or its
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; members.

<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><u>REASONS FOR EMRG TO BE ACTIVATED</u></b>
<br>Summarizing the sections from the RMOC-EMRG agreement and adding a
bit of explanation, there are really three reasons for the RMOC to call
on the services of EMRG:
<p>1. If during an emergency, existing communications within all or a portion
of the Region fail or
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; become overloaded such as:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Failure or overload of any or all of the
mobile radio systems used by police, fire, regional works
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etc.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Failure of phone communications both wired
or wireless
<p>2. If during an emergency, communications systems do not exist for a
specified purpose. This could
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be a way to provide:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; A common radio system for agencies that
do not have radios or have their own private radio
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; systems on different frequencies
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &middot; Communications to an area or building that
is not equipped with communications capabilities
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suitable for the task at hand
<p>3. If a municipality within the RMOC or an agency assisting the RMOC,
requests assistance with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; communications AND the RMOC is unable to meet that
request with its existing resources.

<p><b>RMOC PERSPECTIVE ON THE EMERGENCY</b>
<br>The ice storm created a lot of communications activity and did stress
communications systems, however at no time was the RMOC without communications
or without a solution to restore them.
<p><b>CELLULAR PHONES</b>
<br>&middot; During the emergency, the RMOC used cellular phones to fill
in areas not covered by mobile radio
<br>&nbsp; or wired phones
<br>&middot; At one point the cellular system was beginning to overload
causing&nbsp; the RMOC to discuss the need
<br>&nbsp; for EMRG
<br>&middot; The cellular system did not fail and communications continued
uninterrupted
<p><b>REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE</b>
<br>One municipal fire department experienced a failure in their mobile
communications, causing&nbsp; the RMOC to discuss the need for EMRG once
more
<br>&middot; The problem was resolved through the Regional fire dispatch
and some portable radios
<p>The Mayor of Cumberland put forward a question to the RMOC, asking why
the Red Cross was requesting continued support from the Cumberland Emergency
Radio Group (CERG).
<br>&middot; CERG was running a network control station full time, so the
Red Cross had been using the radio
<br>&nbsp; operators provided by CERG to relay information to other areas
within the Region and bordering
<br>&nbsp; communities
<p><b>AMATEUR RADIO</b>
<br>&middot; The RMOC met daily with the EMRG team leader (Peter Gamble)
to discuss the status of the
<br>&nbsp; emergency and the status of EMRG with respect to the emergency
<br>&middot; The RMOC was aware that the Cumberland Emergency Radio Group
(CERG) was in operation in
<br>&nbsp; Cumberland
<br>&middot; The RMOC Emergency Operations Centre amateur radios were tested
and 2 were made
<br>&nbsp; operational
<br>&middot; The station VE3OCE was active on an occasional basis, checking
in with Cumberland net control
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b><font size=+1>RECOMMENDATIONS</font></b>
<br><u>1) Establish A Presence</u>
<br>In the event of an emergency, where the RMOC is involved and there
may be a need for extra communications, EMRG should be part of the early
response. The initial EMRG involvement would be to establish a presence
within the amateur radio community through a net control station operating
from the EOC.
<p><u>2) One Point Of Contact</u>
<br>Knowing the state of chaos that existed in many small municipalities,
the actual use of amateur radio during the emergency and the last minute
attempts to use amateur radio, it appears that these small municipalities
were not aware of amateur radio as a resource so therefore did not make
a request for assistance.
<p>The RMOC should be the central point of contact for amateur radio communications
assistance in the Region. This needs to be discussed with the RMOC and
if acceptable, communicated to the local municipal units along with some
information on what amateur radio can provide.
<p><u>3) Working Together</u>
<br>There are several groups in and around the Region who provide voluntary
emergency communications. One item that came from the debriefing session
held by the Cumberland Emergency Radio Group, was a need to get together
and coordinate resources and activities to ensure the best possible assistance
can be made available in the area regardless of the borders which define
each group.
<p><u>4) More Space Required</u>
<br>With the limited space in the communications room it would be beneficial
to have some space for EMRG outside of the EOC. This could be an office
which EMRG could use for limited radio communications and coordination,
allowing only the required radio operators in the communications room.
