<p><font face="Arial">Winter 1999 is here and thoughts turn to the ice
storm last year and the upcoming Year 2000.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The year 2000 is a hot topic and EMRG will be busy
getting ready to support the RMOC as we enter into the new millennium.
Start thinking about what your schedule looks like for New Years. EMRG
will be active so lots of operators are required.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Communications exercises have returned, along with
a new structure for ongoing organizing of exercises. The last exercise,
held on November 7, was very successful.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">It looks like a busy year ahead. I thank each of
you for your support in the past and look forward to working with you to
ensure EMRG continues to grow and serve the needs of the people of Ottawa-Carleton.</font>

<p><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>Photo IDs</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial">The January meeting will be an update session for
photo IDs. The latest photo ID cards expire on January 25, 1999, while
some people still have cards that expired several years ago. We hope to
have a new smaller ID, which will be a little easier to carry!</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>Membership Update</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial">It is time again to update the EMRG membership information.
This is done on a yearly basis to ensure that the information is accurate
and that everyone on the list is still available and wants to remain involved
in EMRG.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Please fill in the attached membership form and mail
it to the address shown on the form, or bring it to the meeting on January
23.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The membership form ensures that you remain on the
list and that the information about you is up to date.</font>

<p><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>EMRG-Red Cross</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial">EMRG and the Ottawa branch of the Red Cross have
been working on an agreement for EMRG to provide communications for the
Red Cross in an emergency.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">This is still a work in progress, but there will
be more news at the January meeting.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>Being Prepared</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial">The strength of EMRG is its members and each member
has a responsibility to be prepared. Each EMRG member is expected to have
an emergency kit that contains items that might be required in an emergency.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>Exercise News</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial">On Saturday November 7 at 8:15AM, Richard (VE3UNW)
announced on VE3MPC that there was an emergency and that EMRG members were
requested to stand by. Alan (VE3ZTU) established a temporary net from his
car, while John, VE3EIE headed for the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC)
at the RMOC. Once John was ready at the EOC, Alan transferred net control
over to the EOC.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">By the time John had taken over net control, more
information was available, about the emergency. Severe bush fires were
reported to the west of the Region. Several bush fires had joined together
and the Fire Chief in Kanata had requested help in spotting along the western
edge of Kanata. EMRG members were requested to meet at the Kanata Fire
hall on Eagleson Road.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Marc (VE3DRV) established a local net control station
at the fire hall, using the permanent radio at the fire station for local
simplex communication and brought in a second radio for communication with
the EOC. EMRG members were dispatched for patrols.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The patrols were in progress, when Stittsville reported
problems with its water hydrants. Vandals and fearful residents were turning
on fire hydrants. Stittsville requested assistance and the Kanata Fire
Chief agreed that some EMRG resources could be released from Kanata for
patrols in Stittsville.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">November 7 Exercise Review</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">The date of November 7 was chosen for this communications
exercise, to coincide with the RAC ARES Simulated Emergency Test (SET)
that was taking place in Ontario. This turned out to also be the CPC 125
anniversary breakfast.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The objectives for the exercise were:</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Activate the EMRG membership</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Activate the radios at the RMOC Emergency Operations
Centre (EOC) on Lisgar Street in Ottawa.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Activate the radio at the Kanata fire hall on Eagleson
Road.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Practice message handling of formal and tactical messages.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Test communications between the EOC and Kanata fire
station and within the Region, using amateur repeaters and simplex frequencies.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Have Fun</font></li>
</ol>
<font face="Arial">There was a debriefing session two weeks later where
exercise participants and planning team members were able to provide feedback
on their experiences.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Some learning’s for the future were:</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">EMRG needs a permanent radio in the EOC for the XM49ers</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">The Kanata Fire hall radio needs a wiring diagram, simple
ops sheet and additional outlets from the power supply for second radio</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">EMRG needs map standards to ensure common references</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">More training is required for net control operation
and radio procedures</font></li>
</ol>

<p><b><font face="Arial">EXERCISE PLANNING</font></b>
<p><b>On October 14, 4 people got together to start planning for the November
7 communications exercise. The initial group was made up of:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Richard Hagemeyer (VE3UNW)</b></li>

<li>
<b>Mike Kelly (VE3FFK)</b></li>

<li>
<b>Mike Pees (Unit #18)</b></li>

<li>
<b>Peter Gamble (VE3BQP)</b></li>
</ul>
<b>From this group, evolved a structure for regular EMRG exercises as well
as the plan for the November 7 exercise.</b>
<p><b>The exercise-planning group works</b>
<p><b>as a team of three people, plus one member of the management team
as a liaison/advisor.</b>
<p><b>After each exercise, one new member will be brought into the planning
team, the existing team members move over one spot and the exercise leader
moves out. The past exercise leader acts as a "special resource" available
for the next exercise.</b>
<p><b>This constant rotation of team members allows new ideas and ensures
that everyone has a chance to plan the perfect exercise.</b>
<p><b>As part of the debriefing, the planning team was established for
the next exercise on February 27.</b>
<p><b>Richard Hagemeyer has moved out of the planning group, Mike Kelly
is the exercise leader for the next exercise and Mike Hickey (VE3IPC) has
joined the planning team.</b>
<p><br>
<br>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>Training</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial">Three training courses are being planned for 1999.
The details are still sketchy, but the courses are:</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Basic First Aid</font></li>
</ol>

<ol START=2>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Radio Communications</font></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">How to be a better radio communicator, especially in
an emergency. (Net control, message handling, logging, when to talk and
what to say or not say)</font></li>
</ul>

<ol START=3>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Basic Map Skills</font></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">How to read a map, provide common references that everyone
can understand</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial">Seating may be limited in some courses or more than
one course will be run.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial"><font color="#FF0000">Help is required in setting
up the radio communications course. One volunteer is required to oversee
the course, with a few others to create and present specific sections.
Assistance will be provided with booking space, photo copying etc. If you
are interested, please contact Peter Gamble.</font></font></b>

<p><font face="Arial">EMRG is actively planning to provide an overlay communications
network for the Region, to be in place and operational for New Years, just
in case.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Everyone has heard of the Year 2000 "bug" but what
does it really mean?</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Part of the EMRG planning, is the establishment of
a Year 2000 working group for Ottawa-Carleton. The working group will be
made up of representatives from all the local clubs and groups who operate
radio equipment that EMRG would possibly use in an emergency.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Information pertinent to local amateurs and XM49ers
will be made available at meetings and on the web site at:</font>

<p><font face="Arial">Automated Position Reporting System (APRS) provides
GPS based tracking, displayed on computer maps as well as a system for
text messaging. APRS has been in the Ottawa area for some time and there
have been many advances made in terms of coverage and capabilities.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">EMRG is establishing a small APRS working group to
review APRS in Ottawa-Carleton. This group will review:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">What can APRS do?</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">What infrastructure exists?</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">What does APRS do, that would be beneficial for EMRG?</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">What does EMRG need to take advantage of APRS?</font></li>
