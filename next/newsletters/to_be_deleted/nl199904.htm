<p><font face="Arial">EMRG has an opportunity to be the emergency radio
group we all want. We now have contact with local municipalities, but EMRG
must be able to deliver trained resources for joint exercises and emergencies.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Please take some time and think about your commitment
to emergency radio communications. What are you looking for in EMRG?</font>
<p><font face="Arial">What days are best for training and exercises?</font>
<p><font face="Arial">As part of the plan to get EMRG active, we have two
presentations for this meeting as well as equipment displays.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Repeater VA3EMV will be set up in the meeting room,
give a call on 145.490- once you get near the RMOC building.</font>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>The EMRG call out tree is attached to this newsletter</b>.

1 COMPLETE</font></font></b>
<p><b><font size=+3>Congratulations!</font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial">After the ice storm in 1998, several deficiencies
were identified in EMRG. The consensus was that changes &amp; improvements
were critical to the continuation of EMRG.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">It has taken a year to summarize the issues, create
an action plan and initiate improvements, <u>but change is happening and
the response has been fantastic.</u></font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Four Improvements Identified</font></b></center>

<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Clarify the relationship between the RMOC and EMRG.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Become an active organization, not just meetings.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Become known by, and involved in, the local Municipal
emergency response community.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Clarify EMRGs role with the Red Cross.</font></li>
</ol>

<center><b><font face="Arial">Making Changes</font></b></center>

<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial">RMOC - EMRG Relationship</font></b></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">EMRG is an independent group of volunteer radio operators,
made up of Amateurs and members of the XM49ers.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">EMRG and the RMOC have a partnership, which includes
a signed agreement for EMRG to provide communications for the RMOC in an
emergency.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">EMRG is free to operate in any manner it chooses and
to provide assistance to any other groups or organizations that it so chooses.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">EMRG is not part of the RMOC.</font></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial">Getting Active</font></b></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">EMRG had two communications exercises in the past 6
months and the process is in place to ensure they continue with a minimum
of 3 per year.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Repeater VA3EMV was activated as part of the last exercise.
This was the first time it was deployed in its new role as a portable repeater
on 145.490 -.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Basic training courses are being planned.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Local fire departments have expressed interested in
joint exercises.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">EMRG is now the Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES)
group for Ottawa-Carleton.</font></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial">Getting Known</font></b></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">On January 20, EMRG sent an information package to all
11 Municipalities in Ottawa-Carleton. The information package provided
information on EMRG and the services we can provide in an emergency.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">The information package is being followed up with face
to face meetings.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">The response from the Municipalities has been fantastic!</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">EMRG communications exercises target different Municipalities.</font></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial">EMRG &amp; the Ottawa Red Cross</font></b></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Signed a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) on January
23. This provides the basis for ongoing work between the two groups.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Now working on the details of how EMRG can meet the
needs of the Red Cross.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>Photo IDs</font></font></b></center>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<center>
<p><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>EMRG PHASE 2</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial">With phase 1 now complete, local municipalities and
the Red Cross are aware of EMRG and have expressed great interest.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Phase 2 deals with ensuring that EMRG has the resources
to meet these needs.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Phase 2 Has Three Components</font></b></center>

<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Stimulate greater participation from the existing membership</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Promote EMRG to the greater amateur community to get
new members</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Demonstrate a committed working team to local municipalities
through joint exercises.</font></li>
</ol>

<center><b><font face="Arial">Phase 2 Action Plan</font></b></center>

<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial">Stimulate Greater Participation</font></b></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Discuss why participation in exercises is low. Is it
the dates, Sat Vs Sun, time of day?</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Develop an exciting, well planned and controlled exercise.
Request participation in advance, with selected tasks assigned prior to
the exercise date.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Discuss what EMRG members are looking for in EMRG.</font></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial">Promote EMRG</font></b></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">EMRG will have an information table at the OVMRC flea
market on May 1. The booth will have EMRG displays and a pamphlet visitors
can take which provides information on EMRG and how to contact us.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">EMRG team leader, Peter Gamble is contacting local clubs,
offering EMRG as an option for a guest speaker.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Publish news bulletins about EMRG to local clubs for
inclusion in their newsletters.</font></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial">A Committed Team</font></b></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Interest has been expressed by several fire departments,
for joint exercises with EMRG. This is an opportunity to meet primary response
agencies and show what EMRG can really do.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Positive contact with local emergency responders is
the only way to gain respect and ensure the effectiveness of EMRG in an
emergency</font></li>
</ul>

<center>
<p><br><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>XM49 EOC RADIO</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial">At this time, there is not a radio in the Emergency
Operations Centre, for the XM49ers. For the last exercise, Keith Fish brought
in a radio and set up operation, but this is not always a possibility.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">The RMOC has agreed to move an existing VHF emergency
radio, which is no longer required due to the new trunked radio system.
The radio will be moved once the new 800Mhz radios are in installed in
the EOC.</font>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<center><b><font face="Bookman Old Style"><font size=+2>IS THIS NECESSARY</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Arial">Some people argue that amateur radio operators and
XM49ers have been using radios for many years and do not need to waste
time with training and meetings. In an emergency, lots of radio operators
will respond if someone really needs help.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">In a recent comedy routine, the comics line went
something like this;</font>
<p><i><font face="Arial">"he once looked down from a building and saw the
police, or were they just people dressed up as police, but then that's
what police are, people dressed up as police."</font></i>
<p><font face="Arial">The point is, we would not feel safe if we knew we
were being protected by a group of people dressed up as police. The difference
between people dressed up as police and real police, is training.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Most amateurs operate using repeaters, avoiding areas
with a poor signal. If you have a choice, you can wait until you reach
a better location to send your message. But what if the spot with the poor
signal is the spot where the emergency is happening. You now have no choice,
you must communicate from that spot.</font>
<p><b><font face="Arial">Exercises and training provide several important
items:</font></b>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial">Developing an effective team requires practice as a
team. We need to know our teammates, their strengths and weaknesses.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Trust and respect must be earned. In an emergency, primary
response agencies will rely on those groups they know they can trust. Emergencies
are not the time to meet primary response agencies for the first time.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">The best time to think about how to overcome an obstacle,
is before you are faced with the real obstacle. Exercises force us to deal
with situations that we do not normally deal with.</font></li>
</ol>
<font face="Arial">Another important aspect of planning and organization,
is knowing how to contact radio operators in a hurry. If an emergency happened
while you're asleep, you don't know to listen to the radio for directions.
Call out lists ensure that resources can be contacted quickly.</font>

TIP</font></font></b></center>

<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">How many people have a radio that they cannot program
without the manual?</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">Do you carry the manual with you in your emergency kit?</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial">To save a lot of aggravation and embarrassment, create
a "cheat sheet" for your radio(s).</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial">List each memory channel and the frequency and repeater
name programmed.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial">List the main functions for your radio and the button
sequences needed to perform these functions. Examples are; adding new frequencies
to memory and how to set a PL tone.</font></li>

<p><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Call Out Tree</font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial">The EMRG call out tree is for activation of EMRG
in the event of an emergency. Members have provided contact numbers that
may only be intended for use in an emergency. Do not use this list to supply
phone numbers to other people.</font></center>

<p><font face="Arial">The EMRG call out tree is divided into groups of
three names. The groups form a pyramid with group 1A above groups 2A &amp;
2B. The first person called in a group, will phone the other people in
their group, designating one of these people to phone the next line in
the call out tree. This continues as the calls work down through the list.</font>

<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial">OPERATION OF THE TREE</font></b>
<ol>
<li>
<b>In an emergency, the Emergency Measures Unit (EMU) will call the EMRG
team leader or one of the other people designated as the EMRG Initial Contacts.
This will activate the EMRG call out tree.</b></li>

<li>

<b>The person in the EMRG Initial Contacts, designated to phone the next
line in the call out tree, will phone 1 person from group 1A and 1 person
from group 1B.</b></li>
