<h2>October 25, 2005</h2>

Tom Zink and Brad Smith have been doing some packet testing. Also the
Prescott Russell ARES group has been testing. If you have a TNC, dig it out
and give it a try on 145.030. The digipeater is VE3OCE and there are
stations to connect to; VE3OCE-1, VE3BQP-7 and a Winlink Telpac node
VE3BQP-1.
