<H1>Projects</H1>

EMRG has ideas and equipment for a number of projects to enhance our
radio communications capabilities. These ideas are being packaged into
projects that can be distributed to EMRG members, or any local Amateurs
who are interested in helping.

<p>Some projects will be structured to provide an opportunity for people
who want to help and learn, to work with other Amateurs with more experience.
While the final objective is to improve communications,
this project effort also has the opportunity to help Amateurs learn
new skills and share their knowledge and experience, which is what Amateur
radio is all about.

<p>The purpose of this page is to identify some ideas and projects that
are being thought about and which will hopefully be prototype and developed
into repeatable and deployable solutions. EMRG members can get involved
if they are interested and other amateurs can ask questions or provide
their input to the ideas. There are people working on the Packet Radio
project and the Audio Distribution now, but more help is always useful.

<p>There are lots of things that can be designed and built to make emergency
communications much better. Most of the projects require a bit of
research and testing. From this, you can create a design that brings the
best of several projects together to make the best solution for your situation.
If you have any comments, send an e-mail to ve3oce@rac.ca.

<p>All of these projects cost money and most cost more than the average
amateur can donate. These projects are special solutions that would be
deployed at a few locations, not something everyone needs. Amateur Emergency
Communications groups can outline a project and get sponsorship from local
organizations or businesses, the Red Cross, your local Municipality and
local amateur clubs to help cover the costs.

<h2>Communicating Through Glass</h2>

Most buildings today do not have windows that open, there are few doors and most doors are kept secure.
This raises the question of how to communicate from inside the building using a radio.
This gets even more difficult if the building is a hospital.
EMRG is looking at different possibilities, such as cross-band repeaters and Infrared Transmitters or Audio Coupling,
that can attach to a window.

<h2><a NAME="Communicating Through Glass"></a>Communicating Through Glass</h2>

Most buildings built today have thermopane windows (sealed double glass
with vacuum or gas between) and ventilation systems for exchanging the
air, making a building with no windows that open. These windows are big
typically and expensive, so the statement "in an emergency you can break
a window" is not a suitable answer due to the cost and weather implications.

<h2>GE Phoenix SX UHF radios and GE PSX-200 VHF, and GE Custom MVP Radios</h2>

<p>EMRG has been donated some GE Phoenix SX UHF radios and GE PSX-200 VHF radios.
These were made by GE and can be programmed using a computer with a custom interface
board and software.

<p>The GE Custom MVP is a relatively compact, simple crystal controlled radio.
Its value is in it's design, which has a separate Transmit and Receive section.
This allows the radio to be modified to allow full duplex
(simultaneous Transmit and Receive) operation.
The modifications are well documented and NHRC has built a controller
that fits inside the radio. Click on the radio to go to the NHRC web page.

<p>EMRG could use these radios for in band repeaters or small portable repeaters.

<h2>Red Cross Radio Project</h2>

<h3>October 25, 2005</h3>

The Red Cross radio project is progressing. I am nearly finished building
the cabinet. The cabinet had to be only 12" wide to fit in the space
available, and must hold 5 radios, a TNC, a power supply and a battery. Each
piece of equipment is on a sliding shelf, so it can be removed for repair or
replacement easily. I designed and built the cabinet, but I will be getting
others to do the wiring and help with the installation. (More later)



<h2><a NAME="DC & AC Power"></a>DC and AC Power</h2>

The basic requirement for providing amateur radio communications is
a radio and a means to power that radio. The power can come from a power
supply or from batteries or both. The AC power for the power supply can
come from the power grid or from a generator or both.

<h2><a NAME="Stacking Crates"></a>Stacking Crates</h2>

It can be frustrating to find containers in which to install equipment,
because the equipment is not of uniform size and the containers that work
for one piece of equipment are a bit short or a bit too narrow for other
equipment. With non uniform sized cases, it becomes difficult to stack
the equipment for transportation and storage.

<h2><a NAME="FAX Over Packet"></a>FAX Over Packet</h2>

One of the most common forms of information transfer, is the FAX machine.
Even for emergency communications, most organizations use FAX, either portable
units in vehicles or as a way to transfer information between offices.
The FAX is direct point to point, you get instant feedback about whether
your message is going through, it is relatively secure and if the information
is in printed form, FAX or sneaker transfer may be the only way to get
the information to another place. (Try sending a picture over a voice network).

<h2><a NAME="Audio"></a>Audio Distribution</h2>

The simplest form of radio set up, uses the speaker in the radio. This
can be improved for emergency use by adding headphones. But what happens
when you need to add a person as a logger. You can use a Y cable for the
headphones, but what if the two people have different levels of hearing.
It would be nice to have separate volume controls for each person.
