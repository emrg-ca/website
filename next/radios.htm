<p>EMRG has been donated some GE Phoenix SX UHF radios and GE PSX-200 VHF radios.
These were made by GE and can be programmed using a computer with a custom interface
board and software.

<p>This is a multi phase project, with the first phase to build the programming interface,
which is now complete.

<h2>GE Custom MVP</h2>

<IMG border="0" src="radios_files/ge_custom_mvp.jpg">

<p>The GE Custom MVP is a relatively compact, simple crystal controlled radio.
Its value is in it's design, which has a separate Transmit and Receive section.
This allows the radio to be modified to allow full duplex
(simultaneous Transmit and Receive) operation.
The modifications are well documented and NHRC has built a controller
that fits inside the radio. Click on the radio to go to the NHRC web page.

<p>EMRG could use these radios for in band repeaters or small portable repeaters.
