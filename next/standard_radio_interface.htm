<h2>Introduction</h2>

The Standard Radio Interface provides a universal connector for
interfacing radios and accessories together. The first phase is to
define the connector and connector pin out that to support physical
interconnection. The next phase will define the electrical standards
for each signal.

<p>The benefit of a standard radio interface is the ability to swap radios
of different make or model, without requiring a custom interface cable.
This might be to replace a radio in a small repeater, or at a shelter
where they are operating with the Standard User Interface.

<p>The standard also allows a cross band repeater to be put on a different
band, simply by swapping the radio. If a shelter has several voice
channels in operation and they are causing interference, then one of
the radios can be replaced easily by unplugging one and plugging in a
radio for a different band. Now the link into the repeater might be on
6m or 1.35m.

<h2>What If My Radio Is Different</h2>

The majority of equipment can be interconnected quite easily simply by
defining the physical interface. There is some equipment that
will not provide the same electrical interface as defined
for the standard interface. In cases where the equipment, a radio, TNC,
or phone patch for example, does not support the standard interface,
additions or modifications will be made to the equipment to meet the
standard.

<p>This may mean adding a circuit inside the radio to invert the PTT
signal, or it may mean adding a small mini box to the outside of the
radio, with interface circuit inside the box.

<h2>What If My Auxiliary Equipment Draws More Than 1.3Amps</h2>

The 1.3A current limit for the auxiliary power within the standard
interface, will support most equipment such as TNCs, phone patches and
repeater controllers. If the device requires more than 1.3A, it must be
wired with it's own 12VDC power connection.

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<h3>Packet PTT:</h3>

It has been identified that the PTT in the rear connector of some radios operates
differently than the PTT on the microphone switch. The microphone PTT mutes
the packet, while the packet PTT mutes the microphone.  This will need to be
addressed in the physical interface.
