<br>The emergency communications services of EMRG are available to the
<a onClick="leavingEMRG();"  href="http://www.ottawa.ca">City
of Ottawa</a> and EMRG is included in the Cities' official emergency plan.
EMRG reports to the Emergency Measures Unit (EMU), but would typically
be used to provide communications for other agencies such as People Services
and the Red Cross.
<p>The current City of Ottawa was formed on January 1, 2001, by the merger
of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton and 11 local Municipalities.

<br>The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) is a member of the Hospital
Disaster Planning Committee of Ottawa. The committee meets regularly to
discuss issues related to hospital disaster planning. Members of the committee
include hospital emergency planners, as well as representatives from all
other key agencies such as Police, Fire, EMS, EMU, Red Cross, etc.
<p>EMRG's role in an emergency is to augment or provide backup communications
for the intra-hospital radio system, which is used to connect the hospital
disaster planning teams together and to communicate with the Emergency
Measures Unit and EMS.

<br>The <a onClick="leavingEMRG();"  href="http://www.ottawa-airport.ca/">Ottawa Airport</a> is controlled
by the MacDonald-Cartier International Airport Authority. In a major Airport
emergency or disaster, the Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) would
typically provide communications for organizations supporting the relief
effort in the community, not radio operators at the airport. Volunteer
radio operators would deploy to support the City of Ottawa People Services
and the Ottawa Red Cross with shelters, backup for the Hospitals if required
or as additional support for logistics such as food services for agencies
at the Airport.
