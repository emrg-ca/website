<h2>Team Leaders Message</h2>

<p>This year and especially this fall, has certainly been busy. It started
on January 1 as 12 Municipalities merged to form the new City of Ottawa.
Now there is only one of everything, including Emergency Measures and the
Fire Dept. EMRG has a signed agreement with the new City and is continuing
to build on the great relationship with the Emergency Measures Unit and
the Fire Dept.
</p>

<p>On Sept 11 I received a call from the City of Ottawa, who was putting
all emergency services on standby. There were no activities in Ottawa that
required our services, but the events of Sept 11 have brought out some
excellent questions about our readiness and response. We need to be ready
for emergencies in our City, but if the attack took place in Toronto instead
of New York, we would have been on our way to Toronto to help. Are you
ready?
</p>

<p>I personally found that some of my equipment that hadn't been used
for awhile was not working properly. Little things I meant to fix up hadn't
been done. This is a good time to pull out everything from your emergency
kit, check to make sure it works and verify that everything you need is
there. If you don't have an emergency kit, now is a good time to start
one. It doesn't have to be fancy, a cardboard box will do.
</p>

<p>With the many changes at the Ottawa Red Cross, they were left with no
communications at their Plymouth street office.  This was an excellent
opportunity for EMRG to help the Red Cross in an area that we have expertise
and they do not.  They now have three working radios, one for their
private frequency, one for the hospital frequency and an amateur 2 meter
radio. More improvements will be made over time.
</p>

<h2>EMRG Management Team</h2>

<p>There are some new faces in the EMRG management team. Each person has
their area of responsibility, but work can be distributed across the team
if required. These people make sure things happen, they are not responsible
to actually do everything. There are always opportunities for you to get
involved to help make a difference.
</p>

<p>The EMRG management team is as follows;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Team Leader Peter Gamble VE3BQP</li>
	<li>Exercises John Senez VA3JBS</li>
	<li>Membership Tom and Liz Johnson VA3WTJ and VA3ELB</li>
	<li>Training Clayton Jenkins VA3CBJ</li>
	<li>Equipment Rick Furniss VE3IHI</li>
	<li>Technical Mike Kelly VE3FFK</li>
	<li>Support Richard Hagemeyer VE3UNW</li>
</ul>

<p>The Team Leader is also the Emergency Coordinator (EC) for ARES and
each member of the management team is an Assistant Emergency Coordinator
(AEC) for ARES.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Photo IDs</h2>

<p>The City Of Ottawa is issuing new photo IDs for EMRG. The new ID is
wallet size with the City Of Ottawa Name at the top and with the Emergency
Measures Radio Group name below it. There is a digital photo (the city
stores the photo on file), your name, an expiry date and the words "Volunteer/Benevole"
on the bottom.
</p>

<p>Due to budget constraints, we are not able to have the IDs done on a
Saturday. Members who complete their membership form, will have their name
added to the list at the Emergency Measures Unit (EMU) office. You will
have to go to the EMU office (during office hours) at City Hall (former
RMOC HQ on 111 Lisgar St) to get a form. EMU staff will then direct you
to the room for getting your ID.
</p>

<p>EMU Office: Main floor, North/West Corner, through the glass doors near
the parking garage elevators. 230-0583
</p>

<h2>Ski Marathon</h2>

<p>The Canadian Ski Marathon is on Feb. 9 and 10 this year and runs from
Buckingham to Lachute. This event is a lot of fun a great way to test your
radio skills. For more information, contact Richard Hagemeyer, VE3UNW;

<h2>Portable Repeater -VA3EMV</h2>

<p>The portable repeater is a 25 watt VHF repeater that can be deployed
in an emergency to provide coverage within an affected area. Deploying
the repeater allows the use of hand held radios and lower power on mobile
radios. The repeater controller has a built in phone patch, which can be
connected if a phone line is available.  The current repeater frequency
is 146.790 --. The frequency will change in the future as the repeater
council makes changes to assignments to better serve the area.
</p>

<h2>Battery Charging Tips</h2>

<p>Voltage is the key to keeping gel cell batteries working properly.
If you don't have a voltmeter, it is a worthwhile investment.
Canadian Tire had one on sale for $10, so look around.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>ALL lead acid batteries, including gel cells, can produce hydrogen
	gasses. Never charge batteries in a sealed container.</li>

	<li>Sealed lead acid batteries will generally not tolerate repeated
	deep discharges, unless designed as a deep cycle battery. A normal 12 volt
	battery should not be discharged below about 10.5 to 10.7 volts (1.75 volts
	per cell x 6 cells).</li>

	<li>Overcharging shortens battery life.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are two main charging methods for gel cell batteries, Cycle and
Float. Cycle charges the battery to its maximum potential, then the charger
is removed and the battery is used to power a device. In float charging,
the battery is charged to a voltage that is below the maximum volts per
cell for the battery. The typical float voltage is 13.4 to 14.1 volts,
depending on temperature. A good value to use is 13.7 volts, which is the
charge voltage at 25oC.
</p>

<p>Use the voltmeter to ensure that the battery is properly charged and
is in the range for typical float voltage (13.4 to 14.1 volts).  If
you do not have a charger with constant voltage capability, then remove
the charger after 12 to 16 hours, or when the voltage reaches the float
level. With the charger removed, the battery should maintain a voltage
above 12.9 volts. Charge the battery if it goes below this level.
</p>

<p>The battery has less capacity when charged under the float method, but
it is possible to leave the charger attached without damaging the battery.
This is the type of charger used in alarm systems. The charger is not sophisticated,
it simply is designed not to exceed the float voltage.
</p>

It takes more than a group of individuals who own radios to
<br/>be useful in an emergency.  It takes an organized team!
</p>

<h2>September 11, 2001</h2>

<p>September 11 (9-11-01) was National 911 day. We have all seen and heard
about the attacks on Sept 11. Many people died in the tragic event, including
several amateurs who worked for commercial radio companies. This article
is a collection of interesting facts that have come out about the World
Trade Centre and the attacks.
</p>

<p>There were 98 antennas on the roof of the World Trade Centre, including
all of the TV stations in New York and 4 FM radio stations. The collapse
of the WTC also impacted communications outside New York. Highway Patrol
communications for two thirds of New Jersey was covered from the WTC building.
</p>

<p>Amateur radio played an important part in the efforts to recover after
the attack. In the 10 days following the attack, more than 350 amateur
radio volunteers provided over 5000 hours of effort. Communications was
provided to support the American Red Cross and to provide supplemental
communications for the City of New York emergency management.
</p>

<p>Support for the recovery effort was enormous. As an example, within
a few days Motorola had shipped at least 36 truckloads of communications
equipment to field teams and customers in the New York City area, Virginia
and Maryland.  An 800 MHz, 15-channel communications system which
typically takes about three weeks to assemble, was ready for shipment in
30 hours.
</p>

Planning solves problems before they happen!

<h2>Simulated Emergency Test (Set)</h2>

<p>On Saturday November 3, the City of Ottawa was hit with an earthquake.
Fifteen EMRG members responded to provide emergency communications. This
is how the ARES SET started for 2001.  The SET is promoted by RAC,
through the Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES). The purpose of the
SET is to encourage all ARES groups to have a communications exercise at
a similar time, so traffic can be passed between groups, allowing the National
Traffic Service (NTS) nets to also participate.  In Ontario, November
3 and 4 were the recommended days.
</p>

<p>The EMRG net used local repeater VE3MPC and traffic flowed within the
net, as well as to our neighbouring ARES group in Lanark County. The purpose
of the net is to gain experience and identify areas for improvement. Training
sessions will be developed to help improve skills, so we get better over
time.
</p>

<p>The SET was a lot of fun, so watch for it again in the Fall of 2002.</p>


<h2>Disaster Communications</h2>

<p>
(From the Training session Sept 29, 2001)
<br/>The terms Emergency and Disaster are often used interchangeably, but
they are different. EMRG would typically assist when there is a disaster.
</p>

<p><b>Emergency:</b> Affects a small number of people and lasts for not
more than 72 hours. This is a sudden and usually unforeseen event that
calls for immediate measures to minimize its adverse consequences.
</p>

<p><b>Disaster:</b> A serious disruption of the functioning of society,
causing widespread human, material or environmental losses that exceed
the ability of the community to cope using its own resources.
<br/>Response to a disaster has distinct stages. Planning and training will
help get to the organized response stage as quickly as possible.
</p>

<h3>Stages Of A Disaster</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The Disaster Occurs</li>
	<li>Chaos and Panic</li>
	<li>Response</li>
	<li>Disorganization</li>
	<li>Gradual Organization</li>
	<li>Order</li>
	<li>Disaster Over</li>
	<li>Recovery</li>
</ul>

<h3>Net Control</h3>

<p>When a disaster does occur, net control is critical. The Net Control
Station (NCS) actively controls the net, specific conditions or instructions
are provided and normal usage of the frequency stops.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>How To Listen</h2>

<p>(And you thought it came naturally)</p>

<p>When an emergency net is called, it is usually because something has
happened. You don't earn any points for busting in and asking "what's happened".
In fact, questions should be coming from the net controller, not the check
ins.  Net time becomes a valuable commodity.
</p>

<p>Because of this, the first rule is LISTEN, even more so than usual.
The second rule is LISTEN, because it is so important it bears repeating.
Even in every day practice, when nothing is going on, you should have the
receiver up and running for thirty seconds to a minute before you think
of hitting the push to talk (PTT) switch. Blip the squelch off to ensure
the volume is audible.
</p>

<p>Practice how to listen. Listen on the inputs of repeaters, so you get
used to the sound of less than full quieting signals.
</p>

<p>Learn the ICAO phonetic alphabet. Learn it well enough that the letter
and its phonetic equivalent become easily interchangeable in your mind.
</p>

<p>Just as with morse code practice, it is one thing to listen along and
get the gist of the conversation, and another thing to put it down on paper
with 100% solid copy.To improve your ability and get some practice, try
listening to a yak net with pencil in hand. Copy the check ins as they
come in. Write down the call signs, names and locations given. Do it on
their first transmission. Remember, the idea is to get it right the FIRST
time.
</p>

<p>How many times have you heard the net controller say "Was that an O
or a Q? Sorry, I couldn't read my own writing." If you can't read
it, you needn't have written it. Don't rely on a keyboard, as it
won't be there with you at the shelter, or in the 18 inches of operator
cubicle at the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC).
</p>

<p>Once you can copy at the pace of the laid back check ins on a yak net,
try transcribing the weather broadcasts on 162.55MHz. For sustained practice,
try copying Dan, VE3GUU as he lists the swap net items on VE2CRA
(146.940) on Monday evenings (20:10L+/-).
</p>

<p>For any net, try to guess what the net controller is going to do. You
will have been keeping a list of check ins, so you know the order they
will be called in, but try to decide when would be a good time for
them to call for new check ins, or to run the general announcements they
have waiting. If you have an idea of what is going to be said next, you
will have an easier time of hearing it under noise, assuming of course
that the net controller does what you think they will.
</p>

<p>If you think you're really hot, then try listening in to a SSB contest
on the H.F. bands and copy as many exchanges as you can in a given period
of time. Again, the idea is to get it right the first time, without waiting
for repeats. Do you remember the first time you heard SSB on a crowded
band. You likely didn't make any sense at all of the racket. Over time
it becomes easier to pick out call signs from the pile up.
</p>

<p>For even more practice, try listening to public service agencies. Ambulance
dispatch is fair practice, but there is more traffic on the OC Transpo
frequencies. Taxi dispatchers and courier operations move messages out
at a fair clip as well. With a scanner full of traffic and several note
sheets, you will quickly come up to speed.
</p>

<p>Learning to listen may seem like a strange concept at first, but it
does work. Try it and see.

<h2>Membership Form</h2>

<p>It is yearly membership form time again. Completing a membership form
is a small investment of your time to say; "Yes I am still here, still
interested in participating in EMRG and here is my latest contact information".
Completed membership forms are required to get a new picture ID.
</p>

<p>The forms provide a yearly verification of who is still interested and
what is their contact information. Please take a few minutes to fill out
the form and mail it to Tom and Liz. Some may have completed forms last
fall, but we would like everyone to complete a new one this year.
