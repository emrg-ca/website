The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG), also known as Ottawa ARES,
provides communications for the City of Ottawa. From side to side or
corner
to corner, that is over 100 km, just within the City boundary. Since
emergencies
don't understand Municipal boundaries, it is possible that EMRG would
need
to communicate with neighbouring Municipalities or EMRG members may be
assisting in a neighbouring Municipality, reliable medium range
communications
is important.
<p>While some people only worry about preparing for "the big one", EMRG
is focusing on solutions that provide short and medium range coverage,
based on the assumption that it is extremely unlikely that a disaster
will
destroy all phone communications over more than 200 km. This would
assume
for example that if ALL phone communications has failed in the entire
City
of Ottawa, there will most likely be working communications systems in
Cornwall, Brockville, Kingston, Arnprior, Renfrew or Hawksbury. We
don't
need to communicate directly with Vancouver on HF, we need to get
information
to a location that has normal communications systems working. Long
range
HF is a nice to have, but it is less likely to be needed and there are
hundreds of amateurs who have HF and VHF stations at home that are
willing
to act as relays in an emergency.
</p>
<p>The Ice Storm in 1998 is an example of a disaster that impacted
phone
coverage in some areas, but most phone communications within 20 km of
an
outage was working. Amateur repeaters were all working, but mobile
coverage
for the Red Cross was not available everywhere due to the coverage
areas
of the repeaters. While there are many repeaters in or around Ottawa
and
they have different coverage areas, there are still portions of the
City
that have poor or non existent mobile coverage. NVIS provides an
opportunity
to fill the coverage gap within the City and extend direct
communications
beyond the City boundaries.

STEPS</font></font></font></u></b>
<br>
There is lots of information available on the internet, so the next
step is to apply the information in Ottawa in order to understand how
NVIS
really operates and to determine if and how it can be applied here. We
now have someone interested in exploring NVIS operation and the plan is
to get a few more people interested so several stations can be operated
in order to evaluate operation.
<p>The neighbouring ARES group, Prescott Russell also has someone
investigating
NVIS, so the opportunity to work on this together exists, which also
allows
greater joint group testing. Any EMRG members who are interested,
should
send a note to ve3bqp@rac.ca to get involved with the NVIS team.
