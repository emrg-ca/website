<p>We usually think of HF as a long range communications solution which
is impacted by sun spot activity, time of day and weather. To ensure
somewhat
reliable or consistent communications, beam antennas and amplifiers are
required and even then there are no guarantees, some locations may hear
but others will not. For shorter range communications we think of
VHF/UHF
mobile radios and repeaters. Depending on the repeater location,
stations
100 km apart can communicate while mobile.
</p>
<p>But what about situations where there is no repeater, repeaters have
failed or the existing repeaters just don't link the two locations that
need to communicate.
<br>

or mobile<font size="+1">;</font></b>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - across the City
(100km) without a repeater?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - from the East end
of Prescott - Russell to Ottawa?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>How would you ensure that the communications

reliable throughout the day?</b>

Near Vertical Incident Skywave (NVIS) has been around for a long time
(since W.W.II) and has applications in military and commercial
communications.
Some civilian emergency management organizations also use it and there
are a few amateurs across North America that use and experiment with
NVIS.
So what is NVIS?
<p><font color="#000099">"Near vertical incident skywave means forcing
your radio signals to travel straight up (i.e., 80-90 degrees) and back</font>
<br>
<font color="#000099">down. This achieves radio coverage in circle
having a radius of 300 miles and more. Stop and think about that for a</font>
<br>
<font color="#000099">moment. Complete coverage within such a circle
on frequencies between 2 and 10 or 12 Megahertz. Some readers</font>
<br>
<font color="#000099">may wonder what's so good about this. We are
talking about dependable local area high frequency communications</font>
<br>
<font color="#000099">-- the type we need for tactical public safety
communications in the Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service. In tactical</font>
<br>
<font color="#000099">communications we don't want DX."</font>

an excellent introduction to NVIS.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; <font color="#000099">"NVIS , short for Near Vertical
Incident
Skywave, utilizes high-angle skywave paths between stations instead of
ground wave or surface wave in order to communicate via HF radio. NVIS
was originally evaluated by U.S. Army Forces in Thailand during the
Vietnam
conflict in the mid-1960's It was found that Mobile stations, using
whip
antennas bent parallel to the ground, could communicate more reliably
with
their base-stations. Signal strengths would be weaker using high-angle
skywave but communications would be more reliable, less subject to
fading,
and consistent between stations. This was because the intervening
terrain
was less of an absorber of signals. Terrain obstructions between
stations,
such as hills, mountainous areas, jungle growth, built-up areas with
tall
buildings, no longer become path obstructions with stations when NVIS
techniques
are employed. For distances out to 400 miles between stations, one
F-layer
hop, at vertical angles of 45 degrees or higher are used. It is not
necessary
to have high power transmitters. Typical 100 watt power levels are
fine.
It is necessary that all stations on an NVIS radio network use antennas
that are parallel to the ground and the frequencies used are chosen via
a radio propagation prediction program in order to have best results."</font>

<big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Frequencies</span></big></big><br>
<p>NVIS operation is best in the 2 MHz to 10 MHz range, which makes 80m
&amp; 40m prime frequencies, with 30m having some possibility. With the
new 5 MHz (60m) allocation in the US and UK, this could provide another
useful frequency if the allocation were available in Canada. The
importance
of having a range of frequencies, is to ensure consistent
communications
regardless of time of day or other conditions. The operating frequency
must change during the day and night periods.
