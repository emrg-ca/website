<h1>EMRG And NVIS</h1>

<h2>Dependable HF Coverage Within 400 km</h2>

<p>The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG), also known as Ottawa ARES,
provides communications for the City of Ottawa. From side to side or
corner to corner, that is over 100 km, just within the City boundary. Since
emergencies don't understand Municipal boundaries, it is possible that EMRG would
need to communicate with neighbouring Municipalities or EMRG members may be
assisting in a neighbouring Municipality, reliable medium range communications
is important.
</p>

<p>While some people only worry about preparing for "the big one", EMRG
is focusing on solutions that provide short and medium range coverage,
based on the assumption that it is extremely unlikely that a disaster will
destroy all phone communications over more than 200 km. This would assume
for example that if ALL phone communications has failed in the entire City
of Ottawa, there will most likely be working communications systems in
Cornwall, Brockville, Kingston, Arnprior, Renfrew or Hawksbury. We don't
need to communicate directly with Vancouver on HF, we need to get information
to a location that has normal communications systems working. Long range
HF is a nice to have, but it is less likely to be needed and there are
hundreds of amateurs who have HF and VHF stations at home that are willing
to act as relays in an emergency.
</p>

<p>The Ice Storm in 1998 is an example of a disaster that impacted phone
coverage in some areas, but most phone communications within 20 km of an
outage was working. Amateur repeaters were all working, but mobile coverage
for the Red Cross was not available everywhere due to the coverage areas
of the repeaters. While there are many repeaters in or around Ottawa and
they have different coverage areas, there are still portions of the City
that have poor or non existent mobile coverage. NVIS provides an opportunity
to fill the coverage gap within the City and extend direct communications
beyond the City boundaries.
</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>There is lots of information available on the Internet, so the next
step is to apply the information in Ottawa in order to understand how NVIS
really operates and to determine if and how it can be applied here. We
now have someone interested in exploring NVIS operation and the plan is
to get a few more people interested so several stations can be operated
in order to evaluate operation.
</p>

<p>The neighbouring ARES group, Prescott Russell also has someone investigating
NVIS, so the opportunity to work on this together exists, which also allows
greater joint group testing. Any EMRG members who are interested, should
send a note to ve3bqp@rac.ca to get involved with the NVIS team.
