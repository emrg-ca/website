<h1>Introduction To NVIS</h1>

<h2>Dependable HF Coverage Within 400 km</h2>

<p>We usually think of HF as a long range communications solution which
is impacted by sun spot activity, time of day and weather. To ensure somewhat
reliable or consistent communications, beam antennas and amplifiers are
required and even then there are no guarantees, some locations may hear
but others will not. For shorter range communications we think of VHF/UHF
mobile radios and repeaters. Depending on the repeater location, stations
100 km apart can communicate while mobile.
</p>

<p>But what about situations where there is no repeater, repeaters have
failed or the existing repeaters just don't link the two locations that
need to communicate.
</p>

<h2>How would you communicate, from a fixed location or mobile</h2>

<ul>
  <li>across the City (100km) without a repeater?</li>
  <li>from the East end of Prescott - Russell to Ottawa?</li>
</ul>

<h2>How would you ensure that the communications is reliable throughout the day?</h2>

<p>Near Vertical Incident Skywave (NVIS) has been around for a long time
(since W.W.II) and has applications in military and commercial communications.
Some civilian emergency management organizations also use it and there
are a few amateurs across North America that use and experiment with NVIS.
So what is NVIS?

<blockquote>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
  "Near vertical incident skywave means forcing
  your radio signals to travel straight up (i.e., 80-90 degrees) and back
  down. This achieves radio coverage in circle
  having a radius of 300 miles and more. Stop and think about that for a
  moment. Complete coverage within such a circle
  on frequencies between 2 and 10 or 12 Megahertz. Some readers
  may wonder what's so good about this. We are
  talking about dependable local area high frequency communications
  -- the type we need for tactical public safety
  communications in the Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service. In tactical
  communications we don't want DX."

an excellent introduction to NVIS.

<blockquote>
<p style="font-style:italic;">
  "NVIS , short for Near Vertical Incident Skywave,
  utilizes high-angle skywave paths between stations instead of
  ground wave or surface wave in order to communicate via HF radio. NVIS
  was originally evaluated by U.S. Army Forces in Thailand during the
  Vietnam conflict in the mid-1960's It was found that Mobile stations, using
  whip antennas bent parallel to the ground, could communicate more reliably
  with their base-stations. Signal strengths would be weaker using high-angle
  skywave but communications would be more reliable, less subject to
  fading, and consistent between stations. This was because the intervening
  terrain was less of an absorber of signals. Terrain obstructions between
  stations, such as hills, mountainous areas, jungle growth, built-up areas with
  tall buildings, no longer become path obstructions with stations when NVIS
  techniques are employed. For distances out to 400 miles between stations, one
  F-layer hop, at vertical angles of 45 degrees or higher are used. It is not
  necessary to have high power transmitters. Typical 100 watt power levels are
  fine. It is necessary that all stations on an NVIS radio network use antennas
  that are parallel to the ground and the frequencies used are chosen via
  a radio propagation prediction program in order to have best results."

<h2>Frequencies</h2>

<p>NVIS operation is best in the 2 MHz to 10 MHz range, which makes 80m
and 40m prime frequencies, with 30m having some possibility. With the
new 5 MHz (60m) allocation in the US and UK, this could provide another
useful frequency if the allocation were available in Canada. The
importance of having a range of frequencies, is to ensure consistent
communications regardless of time of day or other conditions. The operating frequency
must change during the day and night periods.
