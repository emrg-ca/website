<h1>Packet Radio<br/>Back With A New Purpose</h1>


<p>In an emergency, voice communications is great for short tactical
messages, but it becomes painfully slow when moving larger amounts of
information such as lists of names or supplies. In the 1980s, Amateurs
were rapidly developing and deploying a technology that would be
suitable for moving large amounts of text information, they called it
Packet Radio.
</p>

<p>Packet radio is almost dead in normal Amateur use, but it is making its
way into emergency communications, driven by two realities which limit
the ability of amateur radio to provide effective communications in an
emergency;
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Limited throughput of voice</li>
	<li>Limited availability of resources (Amateurs)</li>
</ol>

<p>The original packet enthusiasts correctly pointed out that packet could
move information far more efficiently than voice. However like most
amateur technology, it was available for use in an emergency, but there
was limited design consideration for emergency communications. While
packet radio use declined due to its limited backbone speed and the
rise of the Internet, setting up a 1200 baud data link from a shelter
and sending information as text messages is still impressive, even
today.
</p>

<p>The Emergency Measures Radio Group is establishing a project to
investigate, design and implement a dedicated packet radio network to
provide communications between key emergency centres in Ottawa. There
will be a set of fixed locations such as the City's Emergency
Operations Centre, the Ottawa Red Cross and the EMRG communications
centre, plus a set of portable stations that can be set up as shelters
or other temporary sites.
</p>

<p>The emergency packet network will be open to all amateurs when not in
use by EMRG, but the design will be driven by the need to establish a
dedicated packet network to provide emergency communications in Ottawa.
The number of nodes will be limited, but there will be a gateway
connection to allow traffic to or from neighbouring ARES groups in an
emergency.
</p>

<p>Some preliminary investigation and equipment collecting has been done,
but there is a need for more equipment and people to make this happen.
One node software solution that has promise is called FlexNet. This is
a German software solution, which is currently in widespread use in the
Eastern US. The one issue is that the Nodes require a true TAPR-2
compatible TNC such as the AEA PK-80, PacComm TNC-200, Tiny-2, Spirit
or MFJ 1270 series. If anyone has a TAPR-2 TNC they would like to
donate to this project, it would be greatly appreciated. Any TNC,
including Kantronics and Timewave, can be deployed at the end user
stations.
</p>

<p>There will be a planning meeting in early April, so if you want to
learn more, provide some feedback or donate some equipment, please
watch the EMRG web site (www.emrg.ca), or send an e-mail to Peter Gamble
VE3BQP@rac.ca. More information about this project is available on the
EMRG web site under the Packet Radio section; www.emrg.ca/packet.htm.
