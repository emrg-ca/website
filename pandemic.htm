  <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
As a volunteer organization that could be called on by our
<a href="http://www.emrg.ca/partners.htm">clients</a> to assist them with
communications during a pandemic, EMRG must have a plan for dealing with
pandemics. The plan does not need to be complicated, but it must show
reasonable due diligence, which includes a review of pertinent information,
determining the possible impacts for EMRG, and developing guidelines and
information to be distributed to EMRG members. If deployed. EMRG needs to
ensure that our members are not in danger, and are not adding to the problem.

      </p>
      <p>EMRG is
not an expert on pandemics and we don't need to be. EMRG recognizes the
City of Ottawa Public Health Department, called <a
 href="http://www.ottawa.ca/residents/health/index_en.html">Ottawa
Public Health</a>, as the official source
of information, risks and best practices. In an emergency, if EMRG
members are deployed, EMRG would look to Ottawa Public Health for
guidance if required, through the City's <a
 href="http://www.ottawa.ca/residents/emergency/index_en.html">Office
of Emergency Management</a> (OEM).</p>

  <h2><a name="H1N1">H1N1 Flu Virus</a></h2>

  <i><p><b>"This year it's a different flu season.</b>

Not only do Ontarians need to prepare for seasonal flu, as we do every year,
but this year we need to prepare for H1N1.  H1N1 is a new strain of flu â€“
something the world has been dealing with since the spring. Spread of the H1N1
flu virus is thought to be happening in the same way as seasonal flu. Flu
viruses are spread mainly from person to person through coughing or sneezing.
Sometimes people become infected by touching contaminated objects or surfaces
and then touching their mouths or noses. The H1N1 flu appears to affect younger
people more than the seasonal flu."

      <h2><a name="72-HourKit">72-Hour Kit</a></h2>

Everyone should have a 72-hour
emergency kit, so they can support themselves in the event of an
emergency. There are several good sources of information on what to put
in a kit (<a href="http://www.emrg.ca/planning.htm#personalprep">EMRG
Personal Preparedness</a>).
Expanding your 72-hour kit so you have food for a few extra days, and
include items you would use if you are
sick, such as tissues and cold/flu medications would be a good idea. By
stocking up in advance, you will not need to go to the store once you
realize you are
sick, making life easier for you and helping to keep you from
spreading the virus to others.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="EMRGPlan">EMRG Pandemic Plan</a></h2>

<p>The EMRG pandemic plan is still a work in progress and will be posted
once it is reviewed and updated. The draft plan will be
circulated to our clients to ensure they agree with and support the
contents of the plan.</p>

<p>The key ares that the plan will address are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>What are the Symptoms?  What do you do if you have them?
      </ol>
      <div>
      <ul>
        <li>This section will
point to the Ottawa Public Health website as the source for
information on Pandemics. For example with H1N1, there is a special
section <a
 href="http://www.ottawa.ca/residents/health/conditions/swine_influenza/residents_en.html">Frequently
Asked Questions</a> (FAQ).
        <li>The EMRG plan will state that if EMRG is looking for volunteers, and a person has symptoms, they should <b>STAY HOME!</b>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <ol start="2">
        <li>What are the Best Practices to prevent getting and spreading influenza?
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Once again, the Ottawa Public Health <a
 href="http://www.ottawa.ca/residents/health/conditions/swine_influenza/residents_en.html#P9_2237"></a> website
will be the guide to follow. The EMRG plan will also emphasize the key
practices which includes:
          <ul>
            <li>Wash Hands Thoroughly and Often
            <li>Keep alcohol-based sanitizer handy to use when you
cannot wash
your hands
            <li>Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your sleeve (don't use
your hand because it will then touch surfaces and people, which
spreads the virus)
            <li>If you have the symptoms, stay home to limit the spread
of the
virus to others<br>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ol start="3">
        <li>Client Requests, Suggestions and Support.
      </ol>
      <div>
      <ul>
        <li>EMRG provides
communications support to our clients, so we operate at their request,
in their locations, so we need to align with their pandemic plans and
ensure that they recognize EMRG (or volunteers in general) in their
plan. This requires discussion with each of the clients and their
review of the EMRG pandemic plan to ensure we have common understanding
and agreement.
      </ul>
      </div>
      <ol start="4">
        <li>EMRG Operations Changes and Additions.
      </ol>
      <div>
      <ul>
        <li>There are several areas
in which EMRG will make changes or additions to our operating
practices to meet the needs of pandemic planning.
      </ul>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li><b>EMRG Communications Centre at at OFS Dispatch:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Post signs for proper hand washing and use of hand sanitizer.
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Post signs of symptoms
and the request that anyone having these symptoms stay home.
            <li>Include hand sanitizer at several key locations for easy access.
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li><b>EMRG Shelter Kits:</b> Add hand sanitizer and wet wipes to
the list of materials to include in a shelter kit. Also include signs for proper
hand washing, use of the sanitizer and the list of signs and symptoms.
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li><b>EMRG Member Information:</b> Each person must asses their
personal situation to determine if they would be available to deploy if
requested. Some people, such as a sole care giver, or someone with
medical issues should consider the risks to themselves and their
family. There is no shame in recognizing that you have personal
responsibilities and that you are not available for deployment under
these circumstances.
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Battery Backup:</b> Current EMRG design requires repeaters to have at least
8 hours of battery backup. This provides sufficient time for a failed
generator to be fixed or replaced, or for a logical move to another
repeater, or hauling in additional battery power. With a pandemic, the
power outage may be more prolonged, and/or there will be less EMRG
people to bring in more batteries. The design requirement needs to be
assesed, using real power requirements data and battery capacity, to
determine if 8 hours is sufficient, or if it should be increased and if
increased, to what duration.
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Mutual Aid:</b> While Mutual Aid is a key component of EMRG operations
strategy, based on the assumption that there are neighbouring ARES
groups who can provide assistance, is not likely to be possible in a
pandemic. If Ottawa is impacted by influenza, most likely it will have
impacted all of Eastern Ontario. While Mutual Aid from greater
distances could be called upon, there may be issues with bringing
people in over greater distance, reluctance to enter the area, or more
likely a Province wide pandemic, so all areas have the same problems.
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <ol start="5">
        <li>EMRG Member Rights
      </ol>
      <div>
      <ul>
        <li>If an EMRG member is concerned about
their well being, they can identify this to the client manager in their
location, or to the EMRG operations manager. No one will be sent to a
location or to do a task they are uncomfortable with doing.
      </ul>
      </div>

  <h2><a name="Masks">Wearing A Mask</a></h2>

      <div>EMRG will not request members to
wear a mask, nor will EMRG provide masks. The
recomendation or request for volunteers to wear a mask can only come
from the client and the client must provide the masks, along with
education on proper fitting of masks and the proper installation,
removal and care of masks. While N95 is the standard referred to for
health care workers' masks, N95 only specifies the filtering
capabilities of the mask material. Cheap masks may be rated as N95,
however they may not fit properly to provide the protection of the N95
mask worn by a health care worker. EMRG members have the option to not
work in a location that requires a mask.<br>
      <br>
From Ottawa Public Heath, in the H1N1 <a
 href="http://www.ottawa.ca/residents/health/conditions/swine_influenza/residents_en.html#P35_5175">Frequently
Asked Questions</a> section, the following information talks about
wearing a mask:<br>

      <p><i>"Wearing a mask to prevent
infection from the novel H1N1 flu virus is generally not recommended.
Evidence shows that people often use masks incorrectly, or contaminate
themselves when putting masks on and taking them off, which could
actually increase the risk of infection."</i></p>

  <ul>
      <li><b>If you are feeling well</b>,
you do not need to wear a mask while going about daily business. You
should instead take normal precautions to protect yourself as you would
from a regular flu: wash your hands frequently and cover your coughs
and sneezes. For added protection, stay at least two metres (six feet)
away from individuals who show flu-like symptoms.</p>
      <li><b>If you have flu-like
symptoms</b>, stay home until the fever is gone and you are
feeling well. You could wear a surgical facemask to avoid exposing
others to the flu, particularly when you must leave home (for example,
to seek medical care).</p>
      <li><b>If you are caring for a
person with flu-like symptoms</b>, consider wearing a surgical
face mask if you are within two metres (six feet) of that person. Also
ensure that you wash your hands after caring for the person. If you are
at increased risk of severe illness from the flu, it would be best for
you to leave this task to someone else.</p>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <h2><a name="Services">EMRG Services During A Pandemic</a></h2>

  <div>EMRG would provide the same
services for a Pandemic as for any type of Emergency of Disaster. If an
EMRG client such as the City of Ottawa, or Ottawa Red Cross has a
requirement for communications that EMRG can provide and they request
EMRG to provide those services, then EMRG will activate and deploy to
support them. The services would be to support local humanitarian
relief efforts, which might include reception centres (shelters), or similar
centres established for a different reason than the typical storm
or natural disaster.<br>
<br>
There are a few over imaginative Amateurs who believe that
all communications might fail during a Pandemic and Amateur Radio will
be the only remaining means of communications. This is not a realistic
scenario for many reasons, such as the shear number of existing
communications systems that must fail in order to achieve the notion of
"everything" failing and the reality that radio amateurs tend to be
older, and potentially in a segment of the population that might be hit
by influenza, either directly or at least within their household. If
everthing else had failed, then that would imply a lack of people to
maintain and operate all these systems, so it is unlikely there would
be many amateurs left to provide any kind of communications. Finally
there is the reality that the volume of communications that would be
lost if "everthing failed", compared to the capacity that Amateur radio
could provide, especially with the few remaining Amateurs, would be
like taking a squirt gun to a forest fire.

  <h2><a name="ExistingStrategy">Existing Strategy</a></h2>

      <div>Pandemic planning reinforces one
of the components of EMRG strategy. EMRG is developing communications
solutions that are user friendly, so one EMRG person on site can
provide the technical and license requirements, while client staff can
use the voice or data communications solutions directly. Implementing a
robust network, with simple end user communications solutions is
critical to providing useful and sustainable service in a pandemic.
