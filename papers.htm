<h1>Papers</h1>

<p>
	The purpose of the information and papers is to get Amateurs to think about the
	challenges in deploying a radio in an emergency.
	If you are not able to put the radio operator where they are required, are you really
	providing a "valuable service"?
	If the radio operator is in a corner, away from the people who need radio communications,
	is that an effective solution?
	Not all problems can be anticipated or solved, but we can work on problems that we know exist,
	using solutions that we think might work.
</p>

<p>
	To further investigate an idea in one of these papers, a
	<a href="projects.htm">project</a> can be initiated.
</p>

<p>
	Do you have any more ideas?
