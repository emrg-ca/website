<h1>EMRG Partners</h1>

<h2>City of Ottawa</h2>

<p>The emergency communications services of EMRG are available to the
<a href="external_url.htm?http://www.ottawa.ca/">City of Ottawa</a>
and EMRG is included in the City's
<a href="external_url.htm?http://www.ottawa.ca/city_services/bylaws/municipal_bylaws/public_safety/emergency_plan/plan_en.pdf">Official Emergency Plan (May 2002)</a>
<img src="shared/pdficon_small.GIF" alt="PPT Icon" />,
on page 16. EMRG reports to the
<a href="external_url.htm?http://www.ottawa.ca/city_services/emergencyserv/5_2_en.shtml">Office of Emergency Management</a> (OEM),
but would typically be used to provide communications for Community
Services, the City department responsible to operate and manage
shelters in an emergency.
</p>

<p>In the event that more than one group or agency has requested the
services of EMRG, the response priority is always the City of Ottawa.
In a situation where more than one group or agency is requesting EMRG
assistance, it is probably a common emergency and the groups or
agencies are working with the City of Ottawa. EMRG resources would be
prioritized through the Office of Emergency Management, in consultation
with other groups, to provide the most effective use possible.
</p>

<p>EMRG has an excellent relationship with the City of Ottawa, through
various City of Ottawa departments. OEM and Community Services are the
primary groups EMRG works with. The Ottawa Fire Service (OFS) is an
important partner, providing infrastructure for EMRG operations within
the City. OFS provides space for the EMRG communications room and
equipment storage, as well as access to antennas within the City for
EMRG radio repeaters.
</p>

<p>Providing backup communications for Public Safety radio systems is
NOT a mandate for EMRG. If the City of Ottawa radio system used by
Police and Fire failed, or if the Provincial radio system used by
Paramedics failed, EMRG would attempt to assist as much as possible. It
must be understood that there are not sufficient radios, or radio
infrastructure (repeaters) for EMRG to support more than a few key
sites, which is significantly less than the several thousand radios and
over 50 sites they normally use. This is why the radio systems used by
these agencies cost so much, because they have built in fail safe
systems to ensure that the system can operate even in a reduced mode if
something should happen to the system.
</p>

<p>EMRG can provide communications for Police, Fire or Paramedics, to
support Command &amp; Control, and Interoperability, by linking key
sites that are without phone or radio communications, or offload
existing systems of non critical communications. This would
involve limited sites with specific purposes for the communications.
</p>

<p>The current City of Ottawa was formed on January 1, 2001, by the
merger of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton and 11 local
Municipalities.

of the <a href="external_url.htm?http://www.redcross.ca/">Canadian Red Cross</a>
and the Emergency Measures Radio Group have an agreement, throught which
the Red Cross has ccess to the
communications capabilities of EMRG. EMRG operates and maintains the
radio equipment located at the Ottawa Red Cross offices on Catherine Street.
</p>

<p>Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC) and the National Red Cross have a
high level MOU in which RAC will provide communications capabilities to the Red
Cross, through the local ARES group.
</p>

<h2>Ottawa Hospitals</h2>

<p>The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) is a member of the
Hospital Emergency Preparedness Committee of Ottawa (HEPCO). The
committee meets regularly to discuss issues
related to hospital emergency preparedness planning. The primary
members of the committee include hospital
emergency planners, with affiliated representatives from all other key
agencies such as Police, Fire, Paramedics, OEM, Red Cross, etc.
</p>

<p>EMRG's role in an emergency is to augment or provide backup
communications for the intra-hospital radio system, which is used to connect the
hospital disaster planning teams together. The intra Hospital radio system is
called HERO (Healtcare Emergency Radio of Ottawa).

<h2>Ottawa Airport</h2>

<p>The <a href="external_url.htm?http://www.ottawa-airport.ca/">Ottawa International Airport</a>
is controlled by the MacDonald-Cartier International Airport Authority.
In a major Airport emergency or disaster, the Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) would
typically provide communications for organizations supporting the relief effort
in the community, not radio operators at the airport. Volunteer radio
operators would deploy to support the City of Ottawa Community Services and the Ottawa
Red Cross with shelters, backup communications for the Hospitals if required, or
as additional support for logistics such as food services for agencies at the Airport.
