<p>The purpose of this page is to identify some ideas and projects that
are being thought about and which will hopefully be prototype and developed
into repeatable and deployable solutions. EMRG members can get involved
if they are interested and other amateurs can ask questions or provide
their input to the ideas. There are people working on the Packet Radio
project and the Audio Distribution now, but more help is always useful.
<p>There are lots of things that can be designed and built to make emergency
communications much much better. Most of the projects require a bit of
research and testing. From this, you can create a design that brings the
best of several projects together to make the best solution for your situation.
If you have any comments, send an email to ve3oce@rac.ca.
<p>All of these projects cost money and most cost more than the average
amateur can donate. These projects are special solutions that would be
deployed at a few locations, not something everyone needs. Amateur Emergency
Communications groups can outline a project and get sponsorship from local
organizations or businesses, the Red Cross, your local Municipality and
local amateur clubs to help cover the costs.

<br><a NAME="DC & AC Power"></a><b><font size=+1>DC &amp; AC Power</font></b>
<br>The basic requirement for providing amateur radio communications is
a radio and a means to power that radio. The power can come from a power
supply or from batteries or both. The AC power for the power supply can
come from the power grid or from a generator or both.
<p>Power systems may have backup solutions and these solutions can be manually
or automatically activated. An example of a manual backup system is a power
supply and a battery. The back up solution may be to unplug the radio from
the power supply and plug into the battery if the AC power fails. The manual
solution can be automated if the power supply is set up to keep the battery
charged and to automatically power the radio from the battery if the AC
fails.
<p>The size of battery backup varies by application. In a building with
a built in generator, the battery backup may be small (1 hour). If the
AC power fails, the battery powers the radio during the 30 to 60 seconds
it takes the generator to sense the AC failure and come on line. The minimum
1 hour back up capacity keeps the radio running if the generator does not
start. The outage period is longer as maintenance staff works to start
the generator, but there is time for additional battery power to be delivered
to keep the radio running if required. Other locations may not have any
electricity or the potential outage period may be much longer as portable
generators are brought in, so a larger battery capacity is required.
<p>Computers add another challenge, since they typically run off AC power
and they can be damaged by spikes on their power. Laptop computers have
batteries, but the operating time on battery is only a few hours on good
batteries and most amateurs are using older laptops which have less battery
capacity due to age. If the AC power fails, there are devices for generating
110VAC from a battery source. The simplest solution is an inverter, which
connects to the battery and provides an AC outlet. These are available
from many sources. The more elaborate solution is a UPS (Uninterrupted
Power Supply). The UPS provides power conditioning on the normal AC power,
internal batteries and automatic switching if the AC power fails.
<p>One more important component of any solution with backup power, is light.
If the power fails, the radio operator will be in darkness or near darkness.
Even for 30 to 60 seconds, this may interrupt or degrade the operation.
Adding a small 50 watt inverter and lamp with a screw in 15 watt fluorescent
bulb to the system, ensures that there will be lighting, even if the power
fails.
<p><b><u>Modular Power System</u></b>
<br>This project defines a modular power system that can be deployed as
individual components, or as a complete system. The full system would be
deployed for example at a shelter where there is voice radio operations
as well as computer based communications.
<p>MODULES
<br>1) Power Supply
<br>The power supply module is intended to operate a radio at a site that
has AC power, but provides a short term (appx 1 hour) battery backup. The
battery is charged by the power supply, using a <a href="http://www.emrg.ca/ideas&info/gel_cell/pwr_supply_gelcell_charger.htm">modification
to the power supply</a>. This module also includes a 50 watt inverter to
power a 15 watt fluorescent lamp. The wiring is included, to be able to
add more battery power if required. The power supply module is for use
in sites that have a built in generator backup, where interruptions would
be least likely and short duration. IF the power fails, the radio continues
to operate and there is light for the radio operator.
<p>2) Battery
<br>Long term operation requires a deep cycle battery, such as used in
marine applications. The basic deep cycle battery is missing some components
for use as a backup battery. Installing the battery in a container provides
some protection and makes it easier to carry. The battery will require
an automatic charger, to charge it when it needed and to float charge it
for long term maintenance. Standard connectors with fuses are also required
and a voltmeter is a useful addition. The battery module is fully self
contained, with its own attached charger, so it can be used to power a
radio at sites that do not have AC power. For locations that are using
the Power Supply module, but that require additional battery power, the
Battery module plugs in to add the extra capacity.
<p>3) AC Module
<br>There are two issues for AC power; getting power and providing power.
Getting power involves plugging into the wall. For sites with an external
generator, two plugs are required, with a means to switch between the two
sources. Incoming power may not be clean, due to storms or the condition
of the generator, so some filtering on incoming power is a good idea.
<p>Providing power means ensuring enough outlets with filtered power, switching
between sources of power, so the end user equipment does not know and providing
power AC power from a battery and UPS or Inverter, to cover periods when
there is no other source of AC power.

<br><a NAME="DC Load Tester"></a><b><font size=+1>DC Load Tester</font></b>
<br>Questions are often asked about DC power. For example, how long will
battery A last? Will the power supply really handle 10A? The tool for answering
these questions is a DC load tester. The load tester applies a load to
the battery or power supply, simulating a radio or other device connected,
drawing a specific amp rating.
<p>There are suggestions for load testers, such as car headlights and large
resistors, but these solutions have some drawbacks such as heat, how to
protect them, the current changes over time and how to select the amp value
you want to test. In an email list, Jeff Steinkamp (N7YG) recently posted
a design that he prepared, for a solid state load tester.
<br><a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~n7yg/el-1200.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~n7yg/el-1200.htm</a>
<p>The load tester functionality could be expanded with a few additional
components.
<br>1) Variable Duty Cycle Controller
<br>Using a timer to turn the load tester on and off, a battery could be
tested to see how long it will last with a 10 amp load and a 40% duty cycle
(talk 20 seconds, listen 40 seconds).
<p>2) Low Voltage Cut Off Sensor
<br>Using a reference voltage (you need power to run fans anyway), a low
voltage cutout could be set up, so when testing a battery, the battery
cannot be drained below the reference voltage.
<p>3) Discharge Duration Timer
<br>With the variable rate duty cycle to turn the load tester on and off,
plus the voltage sensor to turn the system off once the battery reached
its low voltage limit, adding a simple clock would tell how long the battery
was tested. The clock would start at 0 when the test started and would
stop counting (but not clear the display) when the low voltage cut off
stopped the test. Now it is possible to know how long the battery would
last with the 10 A load and 40% duty cycle.
<p>4) Charger Control
<br>Most batteries have a charger and it would be nice to know how long
it takes for the battery to charge from its discharged state. Adding a
switch for AC power, the battery charger can be turned on and off by the
load tester. When the test starts, the AC power to the charger is cut off.
The battery drains during the test, but when the low voltage cut off is
reached, the AC is turned back on and the load test is terminated, so the
battery will be recharged.
<p>With another voltage reference, set to the value for a fully charged
battery, then it is possible to know when the battery is fully charged.
Add another duration timer, that starts at 0 when the AC power is turned
on for the charger and which stops (but not clear the display) when the
battery full charge reference is reached. Now it is possible to automate
the test of the battery, including draining the battery under load and
then charging it back up.

<br><a NAME="Stacking Crates"></a><b><font size=+1>Stacking Crates</font></b>
<br>It can be frustrating to find containers in which to install equipment,
because the equipment is not of uniform size and the containers that work
for one piece of equipment are a bit short or a bit too narrow for other
equipment. With non uniform sized cases, it becomes difficult to stack
the equipment for transportation and storage.
<p>One solution is to build cases, but the weight and cost must be considered,
which leads to the idea of crates. For years, fruit producers have used
simple wooden crates to ship their product. The main considerations are
low cost, high strength and low weight, which is why the crate style of
construction is worth looking at for Amateur radio equipment.
<p>The first consideration is size. In order to stack the crates, they
must have a uniform size. This does not mean everything must fit in one
size crate. Instead, a basic set of dimensions are established and all
crates are some multiple of those dimensions. Based on looking at a lot
of equipment, I plan to use the following dimensions for a proto type set
of crates;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Width = 10 in,&nbsp; Height = 8 in and Depth
= 16 in.
<br><img SRC="image_files/Standard_Height_Crate.jpg" NOSAVE height=716 width=936>
<p>The width of 10 inches will fit most power supplies, radios and deep
cycle batteries. Some will require less space, but we the objective is
set a uniform size. The height for a deep cycle battery leaves too much
wasted space for a radio, so the 8 in height works well for a radio and
twice that height (16 in) works for a battery.&nbsp; The depth of 16 in
is twice the height and also a reasonable fit for a deep cycle battery,
power supply or radio. It is important to remember that the purpose is
to build a universal set of crates that will fit the radio you have today
or the one you get tomorrow. Some space will be wasted, but there must
also be room for the mic, connectors, some cables etc. or the charger for
the battery.
<p><img SRC="image_files/Double_Height_Crate.jpg" NOSAVE height=734 width=961>
<p>Once completed, if you stack two radios one on top of the other, the
height,&nbsp; width and depth is the same as one battery crate. Now if
you need a crate for a lap top, make it twice the width, so it is 20 in
wide x 8 in high x 16 in deep. The benefits of the crates is in large installations,
such as a shelter. If packet radio is used, then there are two radios,
a lap top, two power supplies, back up batteries and an inverter or UPS.
Add to this a box with extras such as AC Extension cords, coax, paper,
manuals, a lamp etc. The crates will all stack and if designed properly,
they interlock with each other.
<p><img SRC="image_files/Heavy_Duty_Double_Height_Crate.jpg" NOSAVE height=723 width=952>
<p><img SRC="image_files/Crate_Details.jpg" NOSAVE height=691 width=915>
<p><img SRC="image_files/Power_Crates.jpg" NOSAVE height=756 width=996>
<p><img SRC="image_files/Radio_Crates.jpg" NOSAVE height=754 width=987>
<p><img SRC="image_files/Double_Width_Storage_Crate.jpg" NOSAVE height=752 width=984>
<p>Once a design is finalized, the crates could be built from plywood or
aluminum. The corners are angles to add strength and allow the sides to
be open to reduce weight. All connections should be made from the front
or back, so crates can be operated in their stacked positions. Radios and
power supplies must be mounted on a flat plate that can be slid out for
maintenance or to change the radio.
<p>I have some ideas, so I will try them and add some drawings and photos
to the list. If you have thoughts on this, drop me an email ve3bqp@rac.ca.

<br><a NAME="FAX Over Packet"></a><b><font size=+1>FAX Over Packet</font></b>
<br>One of the most common forms of information transfer, is the FAX machine.
Even for emergency communications, most organizations use FAX, either portable
units in vehicles or as a way to transfer information between offices.
The FAX is direct point to point, you get instant feedback about whether
your message is going through, it is relatively secure and if the information
is in printed form, FAX or sneaker transfer may be the only way to get
the information to another place. (Try sending a picture over a voice network).
<p>There are interfaces which use either a full duplex radio link with
duplexers or full duplex using different bands for transmit and receive.
Two systems are required, with one interface connecting to a phone line
at site A and the other to a FAX machine at site Z. This allows the FAX
to work exactly as it would on a normal phone line. There can be problems
with the signal quality, setting up a full duplex system can be difficult
&amp; costly.
<p>I received an email about this topic from Bob VE3INY, pointing out a
simple way to send FAX over packet. The basic solution requires a FAX machine,
two PCs and a simple interface cable. The secret, is to send the FAX to
a PC co-located with the FAX machine. The PC receives the FAX and saves
it as a file. The file can now be transferred using packet radio to another
PC at the other end, where the FAX can be printed. No negotiating over
the air, no full duplex radio links.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>There are several versions of the simple interface cable between the
FAX and PC. Here is one that uses 12VDC (I have not tested anything related
to this)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.epanorama.net/documents/telecom/fax_to_modem.html">www.epanorama.net/documents/telecom/fax_to_modem.html</a>
<p>The system requires user intervention to transfer the file, but someone
with some software skills may be able to automate the process and perhaps
even extract some of the header information so the fax can be routed to
the right destination at the other end (i.e to the Red Cross or People
Services at different locations)

<br><a NAME="Audio"></a><b><font size=+1>Audio Distribution</font></b>
<br>The simplest form of radio set up, uses the speaker in the radio. This
can be improved for emergency use by adding headphones. But what happens
when you need to add a person as a logger. You can use a Y cable for the
headphones, but what if the two people have different levels of hearing.
It would be nice to have separate volume controls for each person.
<p>Now along comes someone who needs to hear a message that is coming in
on the radio. You can hand over one set of headphones or pull out the headphone
cable from the radio so everyone can hear, but wouldn't it be nice to have
an amplified speaker with a volume control, so you can just turn up the
volume for this person and then turn it down again.
<p>What if you want to record the radio audio or add a speaker in another
room. Adding an audio distribution amp to the radio output, will provide
multiple independent audio outputs. Now add a couple simple amplifiers
and you have a headphone amp for each user, an amplified speaker and if
the distribution amp has 600 ohm outputs, you can extend this over the
internal phone cables and add a speaker at the other end using a 600 ohm
to 8 ohm transformer with the speaker, or for more volume, add an amplified
speaker.
<p>These are simple circuits to build and there are lots of examples on
the internet or in the ARRL handbook. The idea for this project is to bring
them all together into one compact unit.
<p>There is an extension to this project idea, which would allow more than
one microphone to connect to the radio. This way the logger/backup operator
can talk when they need to, no handing off of the microphone, changing
headsets for the boom mic. There are some issues with feeding a portion
of the transmit audio from the mic into the headsets, so both operators
can hear. Now you can split the operators up a bit if that makes it easier
to work.

<br><a NAME="Optical Coupler"></a><b><font size=+1>Optical Coupler</font></b>
<br>Most buildings built today have thermopane windows (sealed double glass
with vacuum or gas between) and ventilation systems for exchanging the
air, making a building with no windows that open. These windows are big
typically and expensive, so the statement "in an emergency you can break
a window" is not a suitable answer due to the the cost and weather implications.
<p>In some cases, a cross band repeater in the parking lot with a hand
held inside the building is a great solution. But what about places like
a hospital where there are limits on RF inside the building. There are
systems which use infrared for transmitting audio signals, such as for
some wireless headphones. Distance can be a problem due to signal strength
and interference from other light sources, such as the sun.
<p>Assuming that the situation will allow access to both sides of the window
(inside and outside) and that it is possible to run a cable from the window
inside to where the radio operator is positioned and a cable outside from
the window to a packaged radio with power source. The only problem is how
to get through the window!
<p>To communicate with a radio, there are three signals required, mic input
to the radio, sound out from the radio and PTT to the radio. Using Infrared
transmitters and receivers, it may be possible to transmit audio through
the glass. On the inside of the window would be a small unit with a IR
transmitter for MIC audio to the radio, an IR receiver for audio from the
radio and an IR transmitter for PTT to the radio. This unit would be attached
to the radio using a suction cup like the ones used for moving large sheets
of glass. On the outside is the opposite configuration with an IR receiver
for the MIC signal to the radio, an IR transmitter for audio from the radio
and an IR receiver for PTT to the radio.
<p>There are some issues such as using short tubes to focus the IR signal
to eliminate cross interference and possible use of different wavelengths,
to also reduce interference. Some IR circuits simply modulate the diode
with the audio, while others are much more stable and use a PLL circuit.
With this system, you can go to almost any building and establish a communications
system, without running coax through the building and out a door.
