<h1>Projects Introduction</h1>

<p>
	EMRG has ideas and equipment for a number of projects to enhance our
	radio communications capabilities. These ideas are being packaged into
	projects that can be distributed to EMRG members, or any local Amateurs
	who are interested in helping.
</p>

<p>
	Some projects will be structured to provide an opportunity for people
	who want to help and learn, to work with other Amateurs with more experience.
	While the final objective is to improve communications,
	this project effort also has the opportunity to help Amateurs learn
	new skills and share their knowledge and experience, which is what Amateur
	radio is all about.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of this page is to identify some ideas and projects that
	are being thought about and which will hopefully be prototype and developed
	into repeatable and deployable solutions. EMRG members can get involved
	if they are interested and other amateurs can ask questions or provide
	their input to the ideas. There are people working on the Packet Radio
	project and the Audio Distribution now, but more help is always useful.
</p>

<p>
	There are lots of things that can be designed and built to make emergency
	communications much better. Most of the projects require a bit of
	research and testing. From this, you can create a design that brings the
	best of several projects together to make the best solution for your situation.
	If you have any comments, send an e-mail to ve3oce@rac.ca.
</p>

<p>
	All of these projects cost money and most cost more than the average
	amateur can donate. These projects are special solutions that would be
	deployed at a few locations, not something everyone needs. Amateur Emergency
	Communications groups can outline a project and get sponsorship from local
	organizations or businesses, the Red Cross, your local Municipality and
	local amateur clubs to help cover the costs.
