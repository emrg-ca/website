<p>Mike Kelly (VE3FFK) developed two antenna designs, which were selected
for the first EMRG Antenna Building Party:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dual-Band Discone Antenna made using steel tape measures</li>
  <li>VHF Twin-Lead J-Pole made from TV twin lead</li>

</ol>

<p>The antenna party was moderately successful in terms of turnout,
but the people who participated seemed to enjoy themselves.
The way the antenna party works, is that you bring some parts
(information below), some tools, your interest and
some other people will supply a few key parts and a helping hand, if you need it.
</p>

<p>There are three objectives for having an EMRG-sponsored building session:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To provide an opportunity for Amateurs of all skills to build something and learn new skills</li>
  <li>To provide an opportunity for Amateurs to build something that could be used in an emergency</li>
  <li>To have some fun, to meet new people, and to try something different</li>
</ul>
