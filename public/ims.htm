Amateur Radio IMS Document Set<br>
IMS For Amateur Radio is divided into a series of documents. As
documents are completed, they will be added to the list.<br>

<h2>Document Reference</h2>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="AR-IMS-010_Introduction.pdf">AR-IMS-010 Introduction</a></dt>
  <dd>Describes the set of documentation that supports understanding and
      implementing IMS for Amateur Radio</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Core IMS Training</h2>

<p>This set of training documents covers all aspects of using IMS for Amateur
Radio from introduction to working with multiple EOCs.</p>

<dl>
AR-IMS-011 IMS Overview</span> - Short introduction to IMS
for new members. <br>
<br>
<span>AR-IMS-012 EMO IMS100 Addendum</span>
-
Extends
the
scenarios in the EMO IMS100 Course to include Amateur
Radio and describes the Amateur Radio IMS structure that would be used.<br>

  <dt><a href="AR-IMS-013_Basic_IMS.pdf">AR-IMS-013 Basic IMS</a></dt>
  <dd>Provides more detail on how Amateur Radio would use IMS, including
      scenarios for public service events as well as emergencies.</dd>

  <dt>AR-IMS-014 Intermediate IMS</dt>
  <dd>More detail on operating under IMS, using forms and Amateurs
      accountability when located in a client site.</dd>

  <dt>AR-IMS-015 Advanced IMS</dt>
  <dd>Advanced IMS concepts, hands on exercises and details on how to work
      with multiple EOCs for different clients.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>General IMS Training</h2><br>
This set of training documents covers specific aspects of using IMS for
Amateur Radio, focusing on resource management, use of forms and
identification of IMS positions for Amateur Radio.

<a href="AR-IMS-021_Resource_Management.pdf">AR-IMS-021 IMS Resource Management</a>
Resources
(people and equipment) must be logged and tracked from the time they
arrive to the time they are demobilized and head home. This is critical
to create a permanent record of the event and for accountability, in
order to locate someone, or identify who was in an area if something
happens.<br>
<br>

<a href="AR-IMS-022_Identification.pdf">AR-IMS-022 IMS
Identification</a> - It is important to indentify the Amateur
Radio IMS positions, while not creating confusion with client IMS.
Amateur groups typically don't have a lot of money either, so the
solutions are cheap and won't cause confusion.<br>
<br>
<a href="AR-IMS-023_Forms.pdf">AR-IMS-023 IMS Forms</a>
-
IMS is a standards based solution, so Amateur radio should use forms
as they were created, and limit the use of forms to only those that add
value. Custom forms will be created where there are no good options
using existing ICS/IMS forms.<br>

<h2>Training For IMS Positions</h2>

<p>These documents explain the roles and responsibilities for each of these IMS
positions. Each document includes templates for tasks to complete, which forms
to fill in, who gets the completed forms, etc.  This can be used as training
material and as a guide to fulfilling the position in an emergency.</p>

<ul>
<li>AR-IMS-031 Director</li>
<li>AR-IMS-039 Resource Unit Leader</li>
<li>AR-IMS-032 Liaison</li>
<li>AR-IMS-040 Staging Manager</li>
<li><a href="AR-IMS-033_Safety_Officer.pdf">AR-IMS-033 Safety Officer</a></li>
<li>AR-IMS-041 Group Supervisor</li>
<li>AR-IMS-034 Information Officer</li>
<li>AR-IMS-042 Division Supervisor</li>
<li>AR-IMS-035 Operations Section Chief</li>
<li>AR-IMS-043 Branch Director</li>
<li>AR-IMS-036 Planning Section Chief</li>
<li>AR-IMS-044 Net Control Station</li>
<li>AR-IMS-037 Logistics Section Chief</li>
<li>AR-IMS-038 Admin and Finance Section Chief</li>
</ul>

<h2>IMS Support Documents</h2>

<p>These documents are references or guides to support IMS implementation.
They are not training material, but must be reviewed as part of training.</p>

<a href="AR-IMS-051_Understanding_Emergency_Response.pdf">AR-IMS-051 Understanding Emergency Response</a>

<p>Provides an overview of the complexities of emergencies and how Amateur
radio must manage its service delivery to multiple clients simultaneously.</p>

<a href="AR-IMS-052_Why_Not_Use_ARCT.pdf">AR-IMS-052 Why Not Use ARCT</a>

<p>Provides a review of the ARCT (Amateur Radio Communications Team) concept
and explains why this is an incomplete solution.</p>

AR-IMS-053 IMS Forms User Guide

<p>Provides instructions for Amateurs using IMS forms, to explain any
additional instructions for Amateur radio use of the forms.</p>

<a name="ICS-IMS_Forms"><h2>ICS/IMS Forms</h2></a>

<p>The objective and benefit of IMS forms is standardization across all
agencies and organizations, across North America. With everyone using the same
IMS forms, resources can be moved across the county or country, and integrate
together. Each agency or organization can use the forms that have benefit and
add value in their plans. The goal of IMS is to assist and standardize, not
hinder and overload the users.</p>

<p>Amateur radio will use the IMS forms as written, without modification.  Some
groups modify the forms for Amateur radio, in some cases keeping only the name
and form number the same. Modifying the forms diminishes the goal of
standardization.</p>

<p>Many forms come with notes to assist users filling out the forms. To make it
easier for Amateur Radio, there is document with a set of Amateur Radio
specific notes that covers all forms. This includes where to enter Amateur
Radio information like a call sign, where to enter your ARES group name, or
where to enter the call sign for a repeater.</p>

<p>Amateurs are volunteers and only work with the forms in exercises and a hand
full of real events, so only the forms that add value are used.</p>

<p>The following is a preliminary list of ICS forms that appear to have
relevance for Amateur radio use of IMS. Some may be added or removed over time.
The Resource Status Cards (ICS219) need more investigation on how to implement
them for Amateur Radio, but it might provide a way to track resources and
implement accountability for resources in the field.</p>
