      <p> EMRG - Ottawa ARES has adopted the use of IMS (Incident
Management System) for managing service
delivery to our clients in an emergency.  </p>
      <p>While the IMS structure is standardized, determining how to
use IMS for Amateur radio, and how to align Amateur radio's use of IMS
with the IMS structure of clients is the challenge. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMS For Amateur Radio will be
used in parallel with an ICS/IMS-100 course. The goal is to apply
ICS/IMS to amateur radio, not to write an ICS/IMS course, or define a
"new" IMS.</span><br>
      </p>
      <p>This web page is a work in progress and documents should be
considered draft. As Emergency Management Ontario (EMO) and the City of
Ottawa Office of Emergency Management (OEM) finalize their IMS
implementations, the IMS for Amateur radio documents will be updated to
align with their direction.<br>

      <ul>
        <li>create an awareness of the
broader picture that Amateur radio must address with IMS.</li>
        <li>introduce the concept
of Amateur radio as a service provider to multiple clients, rather than
being volunteer "employees" of Emergency Mangement.</li>
        <li>provide a guide, with examples, of how to use IMS to manage
Amateur radio emergency communications delivery.</li>
        <li>provide a list of recommended ICS/IMS forms for use by
Amateur Radio, with notes on how to apply the form for Amateur radio.</li>
        <li>provide a guide for creating and using IMS identification,
to identify key IMS roles.</li>
        <li>provide a guide for managing resources, meaning people,
equipment and transportation, including local and outside volunteers.</li>

This documentation will refer to the Incident Management System (IMS)
because that is the direction taken by Emergency Management Ontario
(EMO) and this document was written in Ontario Canada.<br>
      <br>
IMS is built on the ICS (Incident Command System) and the names can be
easily interchanged. Many will argue that IMS is ICS.<br>
IMS can be thought of as the ICS expanded to include an Emergency
Operations Centre (EOC), as well as shelters and multiple organizations
and agencies responding, who have each implemented the IMS internally.<br>
      <br>
National Incident Management System (NIMS) is a US Federal directive to
implement a standard Incident Management System Nationally.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2><a name="ICS-IMS_Forms"></a>ICS/IMS Forms<br>
      </h2>
      <p>The objective and benefit of IMS forms is standardization
across all
agencies and organizations, across North America. With everyone using
the same IMS forms, resources can be moved across the county or
country, and integrate together. Each agency or organization can use
the forms that have benefit and add value in their plans. The goal of
IMS is to assist and standardize, not hinder and overload the users.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Amateur radio will use the IMS forms as written, without
modification. Some groups modify the forms for Amateur radio, in some
cases keeping only the name and form number the same. Modifying the
forms diminishes the goal of standardization.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Many forms come with notes to assist users filling out the
forms. To make it easier for Amateur Radio, there is document with a
set of Amateur Radio specific notes that covers all forms. This
includes where to enter Amateur Radio information like a call sign,
where to enter your ARES group name, or where to enter the call sign
for a repeater. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Amateurs are volunteers and only work with the forms in
exercises and a hand full of real events, so only the forms that add
value are used. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The following is a preliminary list of ICS forms that appear
to have relevance for Amateur radio use of IMS. Some may be added or
removed over time. The Resource Status Cards (ICS219) need more
investigation on how to implement them for Amateur Radio, but it might
provide a way to track resources and implement accountability for
resources in the field.<br>
