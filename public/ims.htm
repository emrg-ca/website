    <p>
EMRG - Ottawa ARES has adopted the use of IMS for managing service
delivery to clients in an emergency. The document
<a href="EMRG-413_IMS_For_Amateur_Radio-Draft.pdf">EMRG-413:  IMS For Amateur
Radio</a> is the first step in defining an IMS solution for EMRG - Ottawa
ARES. The IMS structure is standard, but determining how Amateur radio
aligns with the IMS structure is the challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
<a href="EMRG-413_IMS_For_Amateur_Radio-Draft.pdf">EMRG-413:  IMS For Amateur Radio</a>
(about 100 slides; 3.2 MB)
    </p>

    <p>
The document is lengthy, in an effort to create an awareness of the
broader picture that Amateur radio must address with IMS and the concept
of Amateur radio as a service provider.
    </p>

    <p>
Once this document is complete and has been reviewed across a wider
audience, the next step will be to break the information into useable
components which includes the following:
    </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>IMS For Amateur Radio training course that would be used in
      parallel with an ICS/IMS-100 course. The goal is to apply ICS/IMS
      to amateur radio, not to take on writing an ICS/IMS course.</li>
    <li>Defined set of ICS/IMS forms recommended for Amateur Radio. These
      will be standard ICS/IMS forms not modified for Amateur radio, but
      with a set of instructions that are Amateur Radio specific.</li>
    <li>ICS/IMS identification package that includes recommendations and
      templates for creating ICS/IMS identification.</li>
    <li>Implementation packages for each ICS/IMS position that contains a
      quick reference guide for the role and responsibilities of the
      position, plus all the forms required for that position.</li>
    </ul>
