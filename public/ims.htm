<a name="Overview"><h2>Overview</h2></a>

<p>This documentation will refer to the Incident Management System (IMS)
because that is the direction taken by Emergency Management Ontario (EMO) and
this document was written in Ontario Canada.</p>

<p>IMS is built on the ICS (Incident Command System) and the names can be
easily interchanged. Many will argue that IMS is ICS.</p>

<p>IMS can be thought of as the ICS expanded to include an Emergency Operations
Centre (EOC), as well as shelters and multiple organizations and agencies
responding, who have each implemented the IMS internally.</p>

<p>National Incident Management System (NIMS) is a US Federal directive to
implement a standard IMS Nationally.</p>

<p>EMRG - Ottawa ARES has adopted the use of IMS (Incident Management System)
for managing service delivery to our clients in an emergency.</p>

<p>While the IMS structure is standardized, determining how to use IMS for
Amateur radio, and how to align Amateur radio's use of IMS with the IMS
structure of clients is the challenge.</p>

<p>IMS For Amateur Radio will be used in parallel with an ICS/IMS-100 course.
The goal is to apply ICS/IMS to amateur radio, not to write an ICS/IMS course,
or define a "new" IMS.</p>

<p>The key objectives for the IMS For Amateur Radio documentation include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>create an awareness of the
broader picture that Amateur radio must address with IMS.</li>
<li>introduce the concept
of Amateur radio as a service provider to multiple clients, rather than
being volunteer "employees" of Emergency Mangement.</li>
<li>provide a guide, with examples, of how to use IMS to manage
Amateur radio emergency communications delivery.</li>
<li>provide a list of recommended ICS/IMS forms for use by
Amateur Radio, with notes on how to apply the form for Amateur radio.</li>
<li>provide a guide for creating and using IMS identification,
to identify key IMS roles.</li>
<li>provide a guide for managing resources, meaning people,
equipment and transportation, including local and outside volunteers.</li>
</ul>

<p>This web page is a work in progress and documents should be considered
draft. As Emergency Management Ontario (EMO) and the City of Ottawa Office of
Emergency Management (OEM) finalize their IMS implementations, the IMS for
Amateur radio documents will be updated to align with their direction.</p>

Resources (people and equipment) must be logged and tracked from the time they
arrive to the time they are demobilized and head home. This is critical to
create a permanent record of the event and for accountability, in order to
locate someone, or identify who was in an area if something happens.

It is important to indentify the Amateur Radio IMS positions, while not
creating confusion with client IMS.  Amateur groups typically don't have a lot
of money either, so the solutions are cheap and won't cause confusion.

<td><a href="AR-IMS-023_Forms.pdf">AR-IMS-023 IMS Forms</a></td>

IMS is a standards based solution, so Amateur radio should use forms as they
were created, and limit the use of forms to only those that add value. Custom
forms will be created where there are no good options using existing ICS/IMS
forms.

<a name="ICS-IMS_Forms"><h2>ICS/IMS Forms</h2></a>

<p>The objective and benefit of IMS forms is standardization across all
agencies and organizations, across North America. With everyone using the same
IMS forms, resources can be moved across the county or country, and integrate
together. Each agency or organization can use the forms that have benefit and
add value in their plans. The goal of IMS is to assist and standardize, not
hinder and overload the users.</p>

<p>Amateur radio will use the IMS forms as written, without modification.  Some
groups modify the forms for Amateur radio, in some cases keeping only the name
and form number the same. Modifying the forms diminishes the goal of
standardization.</p>

<p>Many forms come with notes to assist users filling out the forms. To make it
easier for Amateur Radio, there is document with a set of Amateur Radio
specific notes that covers all forms. This includes where to enter Amateur
Radio information like a call sign, where to enter your ARES group name, or
where to enter the call sign for a repeater.</p>

<p>Amateurs are volunteers and only work with the forms in exercises and a hand
full of real events, so only the forms that add value are used.</p>

<p>The following is a preliminary list of ICS forms that appear to have
relevance for Amateur radio use of IMS. Some may be added or removed over time.
The Resource Status Cards (ICS 219) need more investigation on how to implement
them for Amateur Radio, but it might provide a way to track resources and
implement accountability for resources in the field.</p>
