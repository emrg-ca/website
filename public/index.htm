<p style="font-size:80%; text-align: center;"> It takes more than a group of
individuals who own radios to be useful in an emergency -- <br><b>It takes an
organized team!</b>
</p>

<p>The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG), which is located in the City of
Ottawa, is made up of <b>trained, federally-licensed, radio operators</b>, who
have made a commitment to volunteer their time and equipment in the event of an
emergency.
</p>

<p>EMRG is a local volunteer radio organization, also known as <b>Ottawa
ARES</b> (or Amateur Radio Emergency Service).  Two names, one group, one
purpose.
</p>

<p>The main role for EMRG is to provide <b>emergency radio communications</b>
for humanitarian response organizations that do not have a radio system, lack
capacity on their system, or normally rely on regular phones and cell phones.
