<h2>Team Leaders Message</h2>

<p>
  Year end is a good time to reflect on accomplishments and plan for
  the future.  It has been a good year for EMRG, with some major accomplishments;
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Emergency Preparedness Display</li>
  <li>Operation Integration Exercise</li>
  <li>Hospital Disaster Planning Conference</li>
  <li>Operations Centre</li>
  <li>Repeater 146.880</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The past year saw long term relationship building pay off and consistent
  growth for us as a group. The future looks good, with lots of opportunities
  to get involved in some projects as radio equipment  becomes available
  from Ottawa Fire Dept.
</p>

<p>
  If we keep up the good work, get more amateurs involved, we will be
  ready for whatever happens.
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; color: red;">
  Emergency Preparedness starts with YOU!

<h2>DC Power Connectors</h2>

<p>
  Ric, VE3IHI has been promoting and selling the PowerPole DC power connectors
  to just about anyone who wants to buy. While each EMRG members gets one
  free connector, additional connectors are available for $2.00 each. The
  power connectors provide a standard interface between radios and power
  sources. You can chew the insulation off the wires and twist them together
  in an emergency, but why do that if planning ahead provides a better, quicker
  solution.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>EMRG Operations Centre Open</h2>

<p>
  The new EMRG Operations Centre at Ottawa Fire Dispatch is now in service.
  The room is about 10' x 12' and is dedicated to EMRG radio communications.
  The initial installation provides radios on 144, 220 and 440 MHz. Once
  Ottawa Fire completes its migration to the EDACS system, then the EMRG
  operations centre will be fully functional, including antennas on the Fire
  Dept tower.
</p>

<p>
  The Operations Centre will be the hub for any EMRG emergency response.
  Net control, deployment and planning will be managed from the Ops Centre.
  There is a separate area to store equipment such as radios, power supplies
  and antennas.
</p>

<p>
  The Operations Centre is part of the ongoing support from the City
  of Ottawa to ensure that Amateur radio can be deployed effectively in an
  emergency.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Emergency Preparedness</h2>

<p>
  An organization's ability to respond to disasters is directly related
  to how prepared that organization is on the whole.
  <br>Organization members go through different training courses.  Groups
  take part in exercises to utilize the training they have received.
  All of this is with the intent to be prepared and effective, should a disaster
  strike.
</p>

<p>
  When a crew comes on duty at the local fire station, they perform a
  whole series of checks.  They inspect their bunker gear, helmet, and
  boots.  The crews inspect the equipment in each of compartments on
  the truck.  Drivers check that the truck is full of gas and that the
  pump has oil.  This is all preparedness that allows them to depart
  to a disaster knowing exactly what the state of readiness their equipment
  is when they leave the station.  The truck is ready to be deployed
  the moment they arrive on scene.
</p>

<p>
  Imagine for a moment that this didn't exist, that the hoses were still
  in the hanger drying and no new hose had been put on the truck.  What
  if the pump's oil reservoir hadn't been filled after the last fire?
  What if the truck ran out of gas on the way to the scene?  What if
  firefighters gear was all piled up on the floor of the locker room?
  What if there wasn't any water in the tank of the fire truck?  Imagine
  the time it would take for the truck to leave the station and arrive at
  the scene if the firefighters had to get water into the truck get the pump
  going and then deploy the hoses to put out the fire on your burning house.
</p>

<p>
  Preparedness starts with the individual and escalates to the various
  levels of organization and government above you.
  <br>The question is, how prepared are you, as a person and as a member
  of the Emergency Measures Radio Group?  The next exercise is intended
  to assist you in being prepared to deploy should a disaster occur.
</p>

<hr>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center; color: red;">
  BE PREPARED
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">
  Keep a battery powered radio at home and put fresh batteries in it each fall.
  <br>Fall is also a good time to replace the batteries in flashlights
  as well.
</p>

<h2>Exercise "Ready, Set, Go"</h2>

<p>January 18, 2003</p>

<h3>Purpose of the Exercise:</h3>

<p>
  The purpose of this exercise is to evaluate your level of personal
  preparedness for deployment to a disaster.
</p>

<h3>Scenario:</h3>

<p>
  Emergency Measures Radio Group has been told that a disaster has disabled
  all telecommunications (wire and cell phone) south and west of Ottawa.
  Search and rescue teams are being deployed as part of a recovery effort
  and food distribution and housing shelters are being established by the
  Salvation Army and Red Cross.  EMRG has been called in to deploy a
  radio infrastructure to support those groups and to assist those in the
  Search and Rescue.
</p>

<p>
  Operators will be deployed across three 8 hour shifts in varying capacities.
  You don't know where you will be deployed and/or if there will be electricity
  where you are going. You've also been told that you'll likely be deployed
  for a 3 day period.  Food and heat will be provided, however, car
  access will not be possible to some areas.
</p>

<p>
  Each EMRG member is to report to the Ottawa Fire Training Center at
  Industrial Road and St. Laurent Blvd. with your deployment kits where you
  will receive deployment instructions and identification.
</p>

<h3>What you need to do:</h3>

<p>
  Bring everything you need with you to sustain yourself and operations
  for a 3 day period, assuming you are being deployed on Jan 18 from the
  meeting location.
</p>

<h3>Evaluation:</h3>

<p>There is no right or wrong here.</p>

<p>
  The purpose is to learn what is needed by each of us as individuals
  should a disaster strike.  The exercise will help identify what each
  of us is capable of so that each of us can improve ourselves as individuals
  participating in a disaster.
</p>

<p>
  The details provided to the Emergency Measures Radio Group are limited
  to the above, so make no assumptions about where you will be deployed or
  what you will be doing other than it has to do with Radio Communications.

<h2>146.880MHz VHF Back With EMRG</h2>

<p>
  In the fall, EMRG applied to the Saint Lawrence Valley Repeater Council
  (SLVRC) to have the VHF repeater frequency 146.880- assigned to EMRG. The
  frequency was assigned to the Cumberland Emergency Radio Group (CERG),
  which is no longer active.
</p>

<p>
  In 2003, the frequency will be activated in a series of Community VHF
  repeaters, located across the City. Each repeater will use a unique CTCSS
  tone pair so a single repeater can be used without bringing up all the
  repeaters. In the event of an emergency, the nearest Community Repeater
  can be used to provide radio coverage in the local area. The repeaters
  would also be available for use by amateurs providing communications for
  community events.
</p>

<p>
  For now, there is an operational repeater  on this frequency, located
  at Ottawa Fire Dispatch in Alta Vista.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Go Kit</h2>

<p>
  Most people have already seen at least one "Go Kit" list that identifies
  the material that each Amateur should have ready in case of an emergency.
  Some lists go a bit overboard and include 16 radios, 2 vehicles and at
  least 10,000 litres of fuel.
</p>

<p>
  There are lots of realistic things people can and should do to be prepared
  for an emergency. Most of the things are simple, so here are a few to think
  about;
</p>

<ul>

  <li>Medications, snack food and drinks</li>

  <li>Buy or build a cigarette lighter adapter cable for your handheld radio.
  <br>You can worry about power supplies or batteries later. (you can always borrow these)</li>

  <li>Build a simple &frac14; wave VHF antenna that can be collapsed for easy transport.
  <br>See the EMRG web site; www.igs.net/~gamble/construction.htm
  [I'll bring one of these to the meeting]</li>

  <li>Buy 30 to 50' of RG8X coax and two connectors. RG58
  (small size) or RG8 (large size) coax can be used, but
  <br>if you are buying new, RG8X has reasonable loss and is mid size.
  <br>[Need help installing connectors, let us know, we'll find an Elmer to help]</li>

  <li>Dedicate a cardboard box, cheap toolbox, old briefcase or suitcase, to keep things in.</li>

  <li>Throw in a few pens, pencils, paper, coins (how did you plan to get pop out of a pop machine), map of Ottawa,
  <br>masking, electrical and duct tape, string, small rope, etc.</li>

  <li>Add more as you get ideas or money to spend. (Just a hint, you will never finish this task, there is always
  <br>something to add).</li>

</ul>

<p>
  Something, is better than nothing. Building a Go Kit is a journey, one step at a time.
</p>

<h2>Simulated Emergency Test - SET</h2>

<p>
  The SET is an annual communications exercise, which takes place each
  fall, promoted by RAC through the ARES program. In Ontario, a specific
  date is set each year for the SET and Local ARES groups in Ontario are
  encouraged to have an exercise on that day and to use the National Traffic
  System to send messages to other ARES groups.
</p>

<p>
  November 9 was the date for the ARES SET in 2002. This year the SET
  was to be a joint ARES - Red Cross exercise, but delays and confusion produced
  a Red Cross table top exercise in Ottawa with a few messages being sent
  out on the NTS.
</p>

<p>
  The Ottawa Red Cross recognized that the exercise did not test the
  ARES - Red Cross partnership, so they are interested in a local  joint
  exercise in the future.
</p>

<h2>E-mail Newsletter</h2>

<p>
  In an effort to limit the cost of distributing the EMRG newsletter,
  we are looking at sending the newsletter via E-mail to as many people as
  possible. For those who don't have e-mail or wish to still receive a copy
  by mail, this option will still be available.
</p>

<p>
  Using the e-mail addresses provided in the membership, we will prepare
  an e-mail distribution list. We will send a short text only notice first,
  so you have to option to opt out before we start sending the newsletter.
  <br>If you have a preferred e-mail address to use or you do not want the
  newsletter mailed or you want a mailed copy, please let the membership
  co-ordinator know.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>MEMBERSHIP</h2>

<p>
  The new membership system seems to have confused and annoyed some people,
  so I'll try to explain it one more time.
</p>

<p>
  The new membership system requires each and every member to send a
  letter, e-mail, or make a phone call, to the  membership co-ordinator
  once per year, in the fall (Sept/Oct). If the membership co-ordinator does
  not hear from you, your name is moved to the next level of membership.
  DO NOT ASSUME that because Tom and Liz know you they should automatically
  add you to the list. As team leader, I have to send in my notification
  too.
</p>

<p>
  The changes were made, because in the past, I did NOT remove your name
  from the membership list if you didn't fill out an updated form. The membership
  list grew, but there were people on the list who had moved away or were
  no longer interested in EMRG.
</p>

<p>
  The new system has three categories of membership;
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Active</dt>
  <dd>Participates as much as possible in training, meetings and exercises.
  <br>Receives a copy of the newsletter.
  </dd>

  <dt>Inactive</dt>
  <dd>Interested in EMRG, but unable to participate in training, meetings and exercises at this time.
  <br>Receives a copy of the newsletter.
  </dd>

  <dt>Archive</dt>
  <dd>No longer interested or able to participate.
  <br>Does not receive a copy of the newsletter.
  </dd>

</dl>

<p>
  You have the choice to be in any of the three categories. Send an e-mail
  or phone the membership co-ordinator to let them know which category you
  wish to be in.
</p>

<p>
  If you were an <b>Active</b> member and the membership co-ordinator
  does not hear from you after the yearly updates are requested in September-October,
  your name will be moved to the <b>Inactive</b> list. If you were busy or
  forgot, a simple note or phone call at any time will move your name back
  to the active list.
</p>

<p>
  If you are on the <b>Inactive</b> list and the membership co-ordinator
  does not hear from you after the yearly updates are requested in September-October,
  your name will be moved to the <b>Archive</b> list. If you were busy or
  forgot, a simple note or phone call at any time will move your name back
  to the active or inactive list.
</p>

<p>
  Not sure which list you are on, send an e-mail to Tom and Liz. Remember,
  we are all volunteers. If your name is not correct or is in the wrong list,
  a simple note or phone call will do.

<h2>Emergency Response</h2>

<p>
  There is a lot of misunderstanding within the Amateur radio community
  about roles and responsibilities regarding emergency response in Canada.
  This often leads to anger and disappointment for Amateurs whose expectations
  were not met.  This article provides a quick view of where the responsibility
  lies for Emergency Response.
</p>

<p>
  The simple answer is, It Starts With YOU, then your local Municipality.
  If your local Town or City cannot cope with the emergency, they go to the
  province for help, usually specifying what it is that they need help with.
  The local Town or City remains in control.
</p>

<p>
  If the Province needs assistance, they will go to the Federal Government.
  The local Town or City retains responsibility for and remains in control
  of their areas. Federal or Provincial resources work through the local
  Municipality.
</p>

<p>
  There are situations where Provincial or Federal emergencies occur and
  these levels of Government can respond directly. The rules of engagement
  and who pays are well documented in the various emergency acts and plans.
</p>

<p>
  If something happens to you, your family or your house, YOU, the person
  or persons involved, are the first responder(s) who are in command and
  must begin the emergency response.
</p>

<p>
  If your resources are overwhelmed by the emergency, such as you need
  medical attention you cannot provide, your house is on fire or you are
  being robbed, the emergency is escalated and the City of Ottawa first responders;
  Police, Fire or Ambulance are called in.
</p>

<p>
  The simple explanation so far, is that when in trouble you must do what
  you can to help yourself and if that is not enough, call 911.
</p>

<p>
  When the emergency affects more than you or your family, such as a forest
  fire in your community, toxic smoke or a small flood, the City of Ottawa
  takes charge.
</p>

<p>
  There can be a large scale emergency, without the need to declare a
  state of emergency. If the City can handle the emergency with the resources
  it has for Fire, Police etc, then they will not declare a state of emergency.
  Declaring a state of emergency activates special powers for the City that
  they don't normally have and they must notify the Provincial Government
  that there is a state of emergency declared.
</p>

<p>
  If the City needs more help, either money or special resources, they
  can ask the Province for help. There is a process for this and there are
  rules about who is responsible for what.
</p>

<p>
  The Federal Government cannot respond until they are asked to, by the
  Provincial Government. The only time the rules change is under specific
  circumstances where the Federal Government can declare a National state
  of emergency.
</p>

<p>
  The Federal Government has a program to provide funding to help with
  emergencies and can call on other government resources if required. Some
  resources, such as the military may come with a bill for the Province or
  City that requested them.
</p>

<p>
  Throughout an Emergency Response, there is official and unofficial assistance
  and co-ordination.  The Province would be aware of a large scale emergency
  in Ottawa, even though a state of emergency had not been declared and they
  were not asked for assistance.  Provincial and Federal agencies may
  be involved because of the type of emergency and such as an airplane crash
  or chemical leak.
</p>

<p>
  Unlike the US, Emergency Response in Canada starts at the bottom and
  works up. There is no Federal Emergency agency that takes over in a City
  or Provincial emergency.
