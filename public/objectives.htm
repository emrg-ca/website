<h1>Defining Standard Interfaces</h1>

<h2>Why Develop Standard Interfaces</h2>

<p>The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) has collected a diverse
selection of radios and radio equipment, such as TNCs, phone patches and
repeater controllers. The equipment all works well and is used in
different applications, depending on its capabilities. In some cases
there are several of same model of radio, while in other cases there
are only 1 or 2 of a particular model. Every make or model of radio, TNC,
phone patch and controller, uses a different connector, or the same
connector wired differently. In working with this variety of equipment,
it became apparent that a universal connection is required to make it
easier to bring equipment together and for rapid replacement in an emergency.
</p>

<p>The purpose of standards is to allow equipment to interface together
using the same connections and protocols. For radio communications,
there are really three things to standardize;

<h3>Replacing Radios</h3>

<p>With these three standards, it becomes very easy to replace a radio if
it fails. The same power, antenna and interface connectors are used.
The end users will maintain their previous capabilities. This makes the
actual radio more transparent to the end users because they don't have
to change to a new microphone, etc.
</p>

<h3>Changing Bands</h3>

<p>There may be a requirement to change radios for operation on a
different band. This could be in a cross-band repeater for example,
where the main repeater will accept a link input from a different band.
All that is required to change bands, is to change radios and antennas.
The existing power supply, antenna cable and repeater interface all
wire to standard connectors, so the radio's band capabilities do not
matter. This may be required in situations where radios cause
interference to other users.
These other users may be the same group trying to operate on more than
one frequency from the same location, or it could be someone else who
operates on VHF frequencies close to the amateur 2 meter
band.
</p>

<h3>User Interfaces</h3>

<p>Standard User Interfaces can be developed that will plug into the Standard Radio
Interface.When talking about people using radios, the typical emergency
situation is two people, one as the operator and one as the logger. In order to
reduce local noise, each person is wearing a headset. This situation
can be enhanced by using either a headset with boom microphone or a
desk mike and a separate PTT switch, either hand or foot controlled.
While this sounds great, very few, if any amateurs can deliver the
setup described. Some may have a headset, but it only allows one person
to hear. If they need to share the message over the speaker, they must
unplug the headset from the radio. In trying to develop consistent
deployment capabilities, it became apparent that a user interface
device is required to distribute the radio connections to more than one
user.
</p>

<h2>Standard Radio Interface</h2>

<p>The first step is defining the physical connection. This includes
connector selection and defining the connector pin out. EMRG has
selected the DA15 (often incorrectly called a DB15), which looks like a
DB25, but with 5 less pins per row. Establishing the physical
connection will solve the majority of the issues, which is connecting
TNCs or standard user interfaces to radios. Most radios support the
same, or close to the same levels and operation, allowing connection to
most equipment without any issues. This phase of the standard
development has a draft proposal which is out for review.
</p>

<p>The physical standard must support as many different types of equipment
as possible. This will include VHF/UHF FM radios, HF radios, CB radios,
scanners, TNCs, phone patches, wired extensions, wireless extensions,
repeater controllers, etc. Each device will support at least some of
the connections, while a few radios might support all the connections.
Here is the document
<a href="EMRG-210_Standard_Radio_Interface.pdf">EMRG-210: Standard Radio Interface</a>.
</p>

<p>The second step is defining the electrical parameters for the
interface. This includes impedance, signal levels and signal operation.
For example, PTT seems easy, but is it normally high, then low to
indicate PTT. How high is high and how low is low/ How much current
should it sink? While some equipment will work together using the
standard radio interface, it may not work at it's best and there are
exceptions in some equipment, so it will not work at all. For
equipment that does not meet the standard interface electrical
parameters, additional circuits will be built into the equipment or
into an attached mini box, so that the inputs/outputs at the standard
radio interface meet the standard definitions. This phase of the
standard development is just starting.
</p>

<p>EMRG has already standardized on the DC power connection, by selecting
the Anderson Powerpole connector for all DC connections. The standard
radio interface is the next step, to allow equipment to be moved and
swapped as required. Not all radios will be a replacement for another.
There are differences in transmit power, number of channels and ease of
programming, but the standard interface maximizes deployment options.
</p>

<h2>Standard User Interface</h2>

<p>There is very little documentation regarding multi user radio
interfaces for Amateur radio. The requirement is often mentioned in
articles about using amateur radio for emergency communications. The
starting point for the EMRG Standard User Interface, is a UK developed standard called
<a href="http://www.familybest.co.uk/cairo/">CAIRO,
which stands for Communications Audio Interface For Remote Operation</a>.
UK Amateurs developed the first standard in the 1980s and did a lot of
ongoing development. The CAIRO system is well thought out and provides
a great deal of end user capability and flexibility. It is well worth
the time to read what was developed and also the reasons that it was
developed. The logic behind the development of CAIRO is the same logic
driving EMRG to develop the Standard User Interface today.
</p>

<p>EMRG will implement the Standard User Interface a bit differently than
the UK amateurs with CARIO. The EMRG interface will use the DA15
connector as the main interface, because that will plug into the
Standard Radio Interface. While the UK amateurs use of the DIN plugs
and jacks was well planned and a good choice at the time, connectors
and their use have evolved, so today there are some new de facto
standards. For example the speaker jack in almost all radio equipment
is a 3.5mm (1/8") mono phone plug. Through the Standard User
Interface, EMRG will define the type of connector and wiring for all
EMRG interfaces. Individual amateurs can choose to follow the same
standard or build an interface between their equipment and the EMRG
standard.
</p>

<p>The purpose of a Standard Radio Interface is to allow more than one
operator to access a radio. The operators could be sitting side by
side, using one interface box with jacks for 2 users, or the two
operators could be separated by an interconnection cable. The Standard
User Interface must allow for connection of more than one user location
to the same radio.
</p>

<p>Development of the Standard User Interface is just starting. Check out the
