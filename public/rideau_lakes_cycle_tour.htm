<h3>June 8 and 9, 2013</h3>

<p>
Support of the Rideau Lakes Cycle Tour (RLCT) will again require many talented,
volunteer radio operators to help out on the weekend of June 8 and 9, 2013.  If
you can volunteer for one or both days, or lend equipment to another licensed
amateur, please contact us.  If you know another ham who would be interested in
volunteering for this event, please consider relaying this message to them.
</p>

<p>
The cycle tour is organized by the Ottawa Bicycle Club (OBC) and runs from
Ottawa to Kingston on the Saturday, returning to Ottawa on the Sunday.  The
RLCT originally began in 1972 and, today, typically involves over 2000
cyclists.  Fixed and mobile amateur radio communications assist the event to
efficiently coordinate repair and relief vehicles across the entire 177 km
course to help keep the cyclists safe and happy (and to remind the public about
how magical radio can be when used correctly).
</p>

<p>
Communication support for this event is provided collaboratively via three
neighbouring Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) groups, namely:  Frontenac
County ARES, Lanark-North Leeds ARES and Ottawa ARES/Emergency Measures Radio
Group (EMRG).  Essential repeater and equipment support is also graciously
provided by several other local amateur radio clubs and radio volunteers come
from all over to help out.
</p>

<p>
The time commitment for radio operators working on the Ottawa leg of the course
is expected to be about 5 to 7 hours on Saturday and again on Sunday (if you
can only volunteer for one of those days, we would still appreciate your help).
The Ottawa section of the course is to be comprised of 10 checkpoints, provided
there are enough radio volunteers.  There is also a need to place a radio
operator in each of the 4 mobile rental vehicles and provide them free
overnight accommodation in Kingston.
</p>

<p>
Basic recommended equipment for this event is:  a 50 Watt 2-metre transceiver
with CTCSS and instruction manual and a 5/8-lambda magnetic-mount
omni-directional mobile antenna (or equivalent).  For some checkpoints, a small
15-foot mast is desirable to reach some Ottawa-based VHF repeaters.  Newcomers
to the event are also most welcome and mentoring will be available.  Don't own
your own radio yet?  If you are a licensed amateur, keen to help, we will
strive to make sure that you won't miss out on the fun due to a lack of radio
equipment.
</p>

details, or to lend your support to the team and help make this event a
success.

<p>
"The Rideau Lakes Cycle Tour is THE Spring cycling event in the area with about
2000 riders going from Ottawa and Perth to Kingston on Saturday and back on
Sunday. Four routes of varying difficulty are offered. The Tour is wholly
organized and supported by Ottawa Bicycle Club volunteers. 
The majority of riders come from Ontario and Quebec but we also have entrants
from many of the other provinces, the United States and occasionally, even from
abroad." (from OBC RLCT page)
</p>

<p>
"Every year, the Ottawa Bicycle Club (OBC) organizes and runs the Rideau Lakes
Cycle Tour (RLCT).  This is a one-weekend event in early June that has bicycle
riders cycle from Carleton University in Ottawa to Queen's University in
Kingston, and back, a round-trip distance of over 350 km. The outbound trip
starts early on the Saturday morning departing from Carleton, and finishing at
Queen's University later in the day. Riders stay overnight at Queen's, and
return along the same route on the Sunday. There are four specified routes, of
which two are supported by repair vehicles, communication and designated rest
and refreshment stops. There can be as many as 2000 riders taking part in the
RLCT, coming from across Canada and many other countries, with over 1000 on the
supported routes. This event takes place rain or shine." (from the RLCT radio
volunteer information booklet)
</p>

<p>
"Given the large number of riders, the range in departure time and variation in
speed, the tour can be spread out over a great distance. Providing
communication spanning the full distance of the tour enables the support team
to co-ordinate, and to render assistance, to riders in need. With such a large
number of riders and bicycles involved, it is inevitable that breakdowns and
accidents will occur, and both do every year. Communication along the route
enables accident location for emergency support, and the most effective
deployment of the two repair vehicles to get bicycles repaired, and back on the
road, as soon as possible. In addition, identification and tracking of the last
rider enables the organizers to ensure that no rider is left behind. There may
be other requests for communication related to riders dropping out, lost items,
etc., as well. Persons participating in communication support are not there to
provide any form of traffic control, or to enforce rules and regulation of the
Ottawa Bicycle Club." (from the RLCT radio volunteer information booklet)
