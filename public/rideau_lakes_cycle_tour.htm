<p>From the OBC RLCT page:
"The Rideau Lakes Cycle Tour is THE Spring cycling event in the area with about 2000 riders going from Ottawa and Perth to Kingston on Saturday and back on Sunday. Four routes of varying difficulty are offered."
</p>

<p>"... And here we are in 2011, celebrating the 40th Tour with registrations having increased to 2000 riders , 4 routes, full tour and ride only options. With a group of about 80 dedicated and hard working volunteers, the ARES communication group, mechanics, OPP support and approximately a dozen loyal sponsors, we have reached yet another milestone."
</p>

<p>Every year, the Ottawa Bicycle Club (OBC) organizes and runs the Rideau Lakes Cycle Tour (RLCT).
This is a one-weekend event in early June that has bicycle riders cycle from Carleton University in Ottawa to
Queen’s University in Kingston, and back, a round-trip distance of over 350 km. The outbound trip starts early
on the Saturday morning departing from Carleton, and finishing at Queen’s University later in the day. Riders
stay overnight at Queen’s, and return along the same route on the Sunday. There are four specified routes, of
which two are supported by repair vehicles, communication and designated rest and refreshment stops. There
can be as many as 2000 riders taking part in the RLCT, coming from across Canada and many other countries,
with over 1000 on the supported routes. This event takes place rain or shine.
</p>

<p>Given the large number of riders, the range in departure time and variation in speed, the tour can be spread out
over a great distance. Providing communication spanning the full distance of the tour enables the support team
to co-ordinate, and to render assistance, to riders in need. With such a large number of riders and bicycles
involved, it is inevitable that breakdowns and accidents will occur, and both do every year. Communication
along the route enables accident location for emergency support, and the most effective deployment of the two
repair vehicles to get bicycles repaired, and back on the road, as soon as possible. In addition, identification
and tracking of the last rider enables the organizers to ensure that no rider is left behind. There may be other
requests for communication related to riders dropping out, lost items, etc., as well. Persons participating in
communication support are not there to provide any form of traffic control, or to enforce rules and regulation of
the Ottawa Bicycle Club.
</p>

<p>Amateur radio volunteers are comprised of members of the Ottawa, Lanark and Frontenac ARES groups.</p>
