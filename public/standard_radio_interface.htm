<h1>Standard Radio Interface</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  This is a work in progress and is presented to encourage discussion
  and refinement in order to document a standard solution.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  The Standard Radio Interface provides a universal connector for
  interfacing radios and accessories together. The first phase is to
  define the connector and connector pin out that to support physical
  interconnection. The next phase will define the electrical standards
  for each signal.
</p>

<p>
  The benefit of a standard radio interface is the ability to swap radios
  of different make or model, without requiring a custom interface cable.
  This might be to replace a radio in a small repeater, or at a shelter
  where they are operating with the Standard User Interface.
</p>

<p>
  The standard also allows a cross band repeater to be put on a different
  band, simply by swapping the radio. If a shelter has several voice
  channels in operation and they are causing interference, then one of
  the radios can be replaced easily by unplugging one and plugging in a
  radio for a different band. Now the link into the repeater might be on
  6m or 1.35m.
</p>

<h2>What If My Radio Is Different</h2>

<p>
  The majority of equipment can be interconnected quite easily simply by
  defining the physical interface. There is some equipment that
  will not provide the same electrical interface as defined
  for the standard interface. In cases where the equipment, a radio, TNC,
  or phone patch for example, does not support the standard interface,
  additions or modifications will be made to the equipment to meet the
  standard.
</p>

<p>
  This may mean adding a circuit inside the radio to invert the PTT
  signal, or it may mean adding a small mini box to the outside of the
  radio, with interface circuit inside the box.
</p>

<h2>What If My Auxiliary Equipment Draws More Than 1.3Amps</h2>

<p>
  The 1.3A current limit for the auxiliary power within the standard
  interface, will support most equipment such as TNCs, phone patches and
  repeater controllers. If the device requires more than 1.3A, it must be
  wired with it's own 12VDC power connection.
</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<h3>Packet PTT:</h3>

<p>
  It has been identified that the PTT in the rear connector of some radios operates
  differently than the PTT on the microphone switch. The microphone PTT mutes
  the packet, while the packet PTT mutes the microphone.  This will need to be
  addressed in the physical interface.
