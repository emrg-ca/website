<h1>Power Supply Gel Cell Charger</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
	The "gel cell" is often used for back up or remote power of radios
	and other amateur equipment. In most cases, the intentions are good, but
	the ongoing maintenance or lack there of, leads to disappointment due to
	short operation times or premature failure of the battery.
</p>

<p>
	There are chargers available that will maintain the gel cell at optimal
	level ready for use, as well as ensure proper charging currents to minimize
	charge time but not damage the battery. The cost for these chargers exceeds
	the price of the gel cells, so ad hoc methods are used to keep the battery
	charged. This article provides one method of charging and maintaining gel
	cell batteries to ensure peak performance and long life.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
	Gel cell batteries that are being charged for backup or emergency
	use, should be connected to a charger that will maintain them at a "float"
	voltage at all times. The typical float voltage is 13.4 to 14.1 volts.
	If the voltage is maintained within this range, the battery can be left
	connected to the charger, without damage. This ensures that the battery
	is at peak performance at all times.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to use a standard 13.8V DC power supply to charge and
	maintain your 12 volt gel cell battery. There are some limitations in using
	this method, but there are also some good reasons to use it.
</p>

<h2>Limitations:</h2>

<ul>

	<li>
		The charge current is low, so it will take 12 to 16 hours to charge the
		battery after extended use. Proper gel cell chargers are able to control
		the charging current, so they can charge the battery much faster.
	</li>

	<li>
		If your power supply has a fixed output (no adjustment), then the maximum
		voltage at the battery is 13.1 VDC.
	</li>

	<li>
		This solution does not scale well to large batteries such as deep cycle
		batteries. The charge rate is slow and the resistor required gets very
		large, wasting a lot of energy. The power supply must be of sufficient
		size that is can support the load, plus provide sufficient power to charge
		the battery.
	</li>

</ul>

<h2>Benefits:</h2>

<ul>

	<li>
		This is a cheap way to maintain your gel cell, if you already own a power
		supply.
	</li>

	<li>
		This solution provides automatic battery backup. If the AC power fails,
		the battery supplies the load, completely transparent to radio operation.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Theory of Operation</h2>

<p>
	The typical radio power supply is regulated for 13.8 volts DC. This
	is about the same as the float voltage for a gel cell battery. In theory,
	you could connect the battery to the power supply for charging. This is
	not a good idea and is dangerous. The problem is that there is no way to
	control or limit the charging current. If your battery was significantly
	discharged, the initial charge current would be high and the battery could
	be destroyed or damaged.
</p>

<p>
	The current can be controlled, by inserting a current limiting resistor
	(R1 in Figure 1) between the battery and the power supply. This will limit
	the initial charging current to a safe level. However as the battery charges,
	its voltage increases, while the voltage across the resistor decreases.
	The decreasing voltage across the resistor reduces the charging current,
	increasing the charging time.
</p>

<p>
	The resistor alone will safely charge the battery, but including two
	diodes adds two important features;
</p>

<ol>

	<li>
		Protection for the battery so it will not back feed into the power supply,
		when the power supply is turned off or the AC power fails.
	</li>

	<li>
		Automatic battery backup power if the AC power fails.
	</li>

</ol>

	<br/><b>Figure 1 Power Supply Charging Circuit</b>
</p>

<p>
	Diode D1 provides the anti back feed protection, so the power supply
	will not drain the battery if the AC power fails or the power supply is
	turned off. The second diode, D2, allows the battery to power the radio
	when the power supply goes off. Without the diode D2, the radio would draw
	its current through the current limiting resistor. The voltage drop across
	the resistor would be significant and would vary depending on whether the
	radio was receiving or transmitting. In fact, receive operation may be
	possible, but the voltage drop across the resistor would be too high for
	most radios to support transmission. Adding diode D2 solves this problem.
	When the power supply is operating, D1 is reverse biased so all current
	flows through the resistor. When the battery is powering the radio, diode
	D2 is forward biased and the current flows through the diode.
</p>

<p>
	There are two downsides to adding the diodes, based on the fact that
	there is a voltage drop across the diode of 0.7 volts. The impact of the
	voltage drop is;
</p>

<ol>

	<li>
		For a power supply with an output of 13.8 volts, due to the 0.7 volts dropped
		across D1, the maximum voltage at the battery will be 13.1 volts. This
		is slightly below the preferred float voltage of 13.4 to 14.1 volts. This
		is better than random charging and overcharging, but it could be better.
	</li>

	<li>
		If the power supply has an internal or external voltage adjustment,
		it is possible to compensate for the voltage drop across diode D1. By increasing
		the power supply output voltage to 14.5 volts (13.8 + 0.7), as measured
		at Test Point 1 (TP1) the voltage measured at TP2 will then be 13.8 volts.
		The battery is now floating at 13.8 volts, which is within the desired
		float voltage.
	</li>

</ol>

<p>
	When the battery is powering the radio, there will be 0.7 volts dropped
	across D2, so the voltage at the radio will be 0.7 volts less than the
	voltage at the battery. If the battery is at best 12.9 volts when the charger
	fails, then the voltage at the radio is only 12.2 volts to start with and
	it will go down from there.
</p>

<p>
	Voltage drop across D2 can be overcome by installing a switch or relay,
	which simultaneously bypasses diode D2 while removing the power supply
	connection from D1. The switch and relay provide identical functions, but
	the relay will do the switching automatically, while with the switch there
	is always the possibility of someone forgetting to set the switch back
	when the AC power returns.
</p>

<p>
	Figure 2A shows the circuit from Figure 1, with the addition
	of S1, a SPDT switch. When the switch is in the position shown in the diagram,
	the battery is connected directly to the radio, bypassing diode D2, eliminating
	the 0.7 V drop across D2. The power supply connection at D1 is broken so
	there is no possibility of accidentally having the battery connected directly
	to the power supply. When the switch toggles, the power supply connection
	at D2 is reconnected and the bypass around D2 is removed.
</p>

<p>
	Figure 2B shows the same circuit from Figure 1, with the addition of
	K1, a SPDT relay. The drawing shows the connection for the relays normal
	(non powered) state. When the power supply is applying power, relay K1
	is energized, pulling the contact up so the radio is connected to D1. When
	the power fails, the relay contact goes back to the normal position, bypassing
	D2 and removing the connection at D1.

<h2>PACKAGING</h2>

<p>
	There are two options for packaging this solution; install the components
	in a mini box or install them inside the power supply. For me, the more
	idiot proof the better, so I installed the resistor and diodes inside the
	power supply case and added an extra set of binding posts for the battery
	connection. You could use a wire and connector instead of the binding posts,
	to connect the battery. MAKE SURE YOU LABEL THE NEW CONNECTION.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
	<br/><img src="pwr_supply_gelcell_charger_files/image6DQ.JPG"  width="600" alt="Modified Power Supply" />
	<br/><b>Figure 3 Modified Power Supply</b>
</p>

<p>
	The wire that attaches to the original positive binding post is cut
	and the diodes and resistor are added. A new wire is added from the original
	negative binding post, to the new battery connection negative binding post.
</p>

<p>
	When the power supply voltage is increased to compensate for the diode
	(D1), the voltage at the original power supply output is still 13.8 VDC
	and there is the option to attach a battery.
</p>

<p>
	If the components are installed in a mini box, which then connects to
	the output of the power supply, the power supply output will be 14.5 volts,
	which is higher than the normal 13.8 volts. It is possible for someone
	who doesn't know this to connect directly to the power supply instead of
	the adapter, which may accidentally cause damage to equipment.
</p>

<h2>COMPONENT RATING</h2>

<h3>Diodes</h3>

<p>
	Diodes D1 and D2 must have sufficient current rating to supply the requirements
	of the load. If the load is a mobile radio which draws 9 amps on full output,
	the diodes should be rated 1.5 to 2 times the required value, which would
	be about 15 to 20 amps for continuous service.
</p>

<p>
	Half of a bridge rectifier can be used instead of two diodes. This configuration
	usually can be bolted to the case to dissipate heat and the tabs provide
	a mounting point for the resistor.

	<br/><b>Figure 4 Circuit Using Bridge Rectifier</b>
</p>

<h3>Resistor</h3>

<p>
	The resistor has two considerations; resistance and wattage. The resistance
	must ensure that when the battery is at its lowest voltage, which is maximum
	voltage across the resistor, the current flow does not exceed the battery
	charging rating. The wattage must be sufficient that if the battery were
	shorted, the resistor would support the maximum current through the resistor.
</p>

<h3>Maximum Charging Current</h3>

<p>
	The maximum charging current is equal to CA, where C is the batteries
	rated capacity and A is the initial current rating from the battery manufacturer.
	The recommended maximum charging currents for gel cells are:
</p>

<p>
	4 Ah = 0.3 x 4 = 0.12A (120mA)
</p>

<p>
	7 Ah = 0.3 x 7 = 0.21A (210mA)
</p>

<h3>Resistance Calculation</h3>

<p>
	R = E/I, where E is the expected maximum voltage drop across the resistor
	and I is the maximum charging current. The maximum voltage drop across
	the resistor is the power supply output minus the lowest possible battery
	voltage. Since the battery should not be discharged below 10.5 volts, we
	assume a low voltage of 10 volts and a power supply output maximum of 14
	volts. Therefore the maximum voltage across the resistor would be 4 volts.
	The resistor calculation for a 7 Ah battery would be;
</p>

<p>
	R = 4 V / 210 mA = 19 ohms.
</p>

<h3>Wattage Calculation</h3>

<p>
	The worst case for the resistor is if the battery is shorted so that
	the full power supply output is across the resistor.
</p>

<p>
	P = E<sup>2</sup>/R, where E is the maximum power supply voltage of
	14 volts and R is the calculated resistance of 19 ohms. Therefore the minimum
	resistor wattage rating is;
</p>

<p>
	(14 x 14)/19 = 10.5 watts.
</p>

<p>
	The actual resistor wattage rating should be 1.5 to 2 times the calculated
	value.
</p>

<h3>Relay or Switch</h3>

<p>
	The contacts should be rated at least 1.5 times the power supply current
	rating. For example, a 3 amp power supply would require a switch or relay
	with at least 4.5 Amp contact rating. Higher contact ratings are OK.
</p>

<p>
	Relay K1 should be as small as possible, with a 12VDC coil.
</p>


<h2>SUMMARY</h2>

<p>
	For the typical 4Ah and 7Ah gel cells, use the three twenties;
</p>

<p>
	Resistor: R = 20 ohms and P = 20 Watts
</p>

<p>
	Diodes: I = 20 Amps
