<p>
	EMRG has been donated some GE Phoenix SX UHF radios and GE PSX-200 VHF radios.
	These were made by GE and can be programmed using a computer with a custom interface
	board and software.
</p>

<p>
	This is a multi phase project, with the first phase to build the programming interface,
	which is now complete.
</p>

<h2>GE Custom MVP</h2>

<p>
	The GE Custom MVP is a relatively compact, simple crystal controlled radio.
	Its value is in it's design, which has a separate Transmit and Receive section.
	This allows the radio to be modified to allow full duplex
	(simultaneous Transmit and Receive) operation.
	The modifications are well documented and NHRC has built a controller
	that fits inside the radio. Click on the radio to go to the NHRC web page.
</p>

<p>
	EMRG could use these radios for in band repeaters or small portable repeaters.
