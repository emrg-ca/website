<h1>Radio Repeaters</h1>



<p>
	Providing emergency communications as an Amateur radio volunteer is
	about more than taking you and your radio out when there is a problem
	in the community. Effective communications requires planning,
	preparation and testing in advance, to understand weaknesses due to
	terrain, equipment or skills. By understanding the potential obstacles
	to good communications, technical solutions, training and exercises can
	be developed in advance, to overcome those obstacles.
</p>

<p>
	Repeaters are an important part of EMRG's emergency communications.
	Effective communications in Ottawa requires a mix of Wide Area,
	Regional and Community Repeaters. Ottawa is a large city, about 85 km
	across (by air), so one or more Wide Area Repeaters are required to
	link locations across the City. There are also communities within the
	City, which tend to define a functional unit. Community Repeaters
	provide coverage within these smaller functional units for local
	citizen patrols or for linking sites of interest that do not need to be
	linked as part of the City wide network.
</p>

<p>
	Regional repeaters provide additional capacity within communities, or
	to link communities together or to central communications sites. The
	Regional repeaters have greater coverage than a community repeater, but
	not as much as a wide area repeater.
</p>

<p>
	Some ask "Why so many repeaters", which is a good question. EMRG is
	preparing for an unknown emergency, which has caused unknown damage.
	Some or all of the repeaters may not be available. With enough repeater
	infrastructure in place, there is a good chance that some of it will be
	functional, to provide emergency communications.
</p>

<p>
	Ottawa has a large number of repeaters in place today and the repeater
	owners willingly make their repeaters available in an emergency. EMRG
	repeaters fill in the gaps.
</p>

<h2>Why EMRG Repeaters?</h2>

<p>
	Several years ago, Team leader Peter Gamble stated that EMRG did not need to
	own any voice repeaters. EMRG would rely on the repeater infrastructure provided by
	local Amateur radio clubs. Over the last couple years this view has changed, for several reasons;
</p>

<ul>

	<li>
		Many local repeaters have had performance issues, the owners are
		aging, and site access is getting difficult
	</li>

	<li>
		EMRG has access to surplus repeater equipment and radio sites across the City
	</li>

	<li>
		EMRG better understands the requirements to provide emergency
		communications, the challenges in Ottawa and limitations of existing repeaters.
	</li>

</ul>

<p>
	Like everything in life, the preferred option is to use the best tool for the job. Using a
	wide area repeater for local community communications is not an effective use of
	resources. Community repeaters provide a solution for local communications and
	Regional repeaters provide a link between communities. Wide Area repeaters link the
	entire City and provide access to neighbouring Municipalities and radio groups.
	In an emergency, there are many reasons why having more than one repeater is important;
</p>

<ul>
	<li>some repeaters may not be working</li>
	<li>the affected area may not be covered by some repeaters</li>
	<li>more than one communications network may be required</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Emergency communications is about providing communications where it is required,
	which may not be where it is convenient or easy for Amateurs using the  local radio network.
</p>

<p>
	EMRG has a plan to establish several repeaters across the City of Ottawa to
	augment the existing capacity provided by club repeaters. These new
	repeaters ensure that in an emergency there is repeater coverage in all
	areas of the City, with sufficient channel capacity (more than one repeater
	may be required) and diversity in the event that one or more repeaters fails
	or is destroyed.
</p>

<p>
	The CTCSS tone on the input and output allows the re-use of the same
	frequency in the West end of the City with a different CTCSS tone.
</p>


<h2>Repeater Coverage</h2>

<p>
	As you go South on Bank Street, past Leitrim Road, you notice an uphill drive.
	This levels off after a couple kilometres and starts to drop just before Greely. This
	section of land is not very wide. If you draw a line from the EMRG repeater, through the
	centre of this hill, the line will follow Bank Street going South.
	This hill is enough to block the EMRG repeater to the South, creating a triangle
	shaped area from the repeater, along both sides of the hill, blocking out Metcalf on one
	side and Greely on the other.
</p>

<h2>Repeater Call Signs</h2>

<p>
	EMRG call signs are used to uniquely identify equipment, not operator functions or
	locations. During radio operations, tactical call signs will be used to address operator
	locations and individual Amateur call signs can be used to meet Industry Canada
	regulations.
</p>


<h3>VA3EMU - Emergency Operations Centre Packet Station</h3>

<p>
	VE3EMU will be used for packet at the EOC.
</p>




<h3>VE3OCE - Fire Dispatch</h3>

<p>
	Frequency: 146.880MHz
</p>


<p>
	The call sign for the VHF repeater has changed from VA3EMV to VE3OCE.
	Now all equipment, voice and packet, at the Fire Dispatch centre will use
	the VE3OCE call sign.
</p>

<p>
	The VE3TEL UHF repeater that was on Bank St, has been shut down by the Telephone Pioneers.
	They donated the repeater to EMRG and it has now been moved to Fire Dispatch.
	The equipment was installed in a relay rack in October, 2005
	and the next step is to wire up the controller and get it
	back on the air as VE3OCE UHF.
</p>


<h3>VA3OFS - Barhaven</h3>

<p>
	The repeater output is 146.670 MHz with a 136.5 Hz tone.
	The repeater input is 146.070 MHz either with no tone or with a 136.5 Hz tone,
	your choice. It may be more sensitive with the input tone.
</p>

<p>
	The EMRG repeater at Barhaven should provide good coverage to the South of Ottawa.
	It may be more sensitive with the input tone.
</p>


<h3>VA3EMV - Portable Packet Stations</h3>

<p>
	VA3EMV will be used for portable packet stations and the
	portable voice repeater.
</p>


<h3>VA3EMV - East Ottawa</h3>

<p>
	The Emergency Measures Radio Group (Ottawa ARES) has activated a new
	Community Repeater, VA3EMV/East, in the East end of Ottawa (former City of
	Cumberland). The repeater is located at a fire station and replaces a base
	radio, providing local coverage for mobiles and portables, so all stations
	can hear both sides of a conversation. The repeater is on 146.985 (-), with
	100 Hz CTCSS tone IN and OUT.
</p>

<p>
	The repeater is open for general use related to sharing technical
	information, directions or community service.
