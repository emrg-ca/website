<h1>Suggested Emergency Supplies</h1>

<h2>Being Prepared</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Plan to be spontaneous.</li>

  <li>The key to being successful in an emergency is PLANNING
    and the time to start planning for an emergency is NOW.</li>

  <li>In an emergency or a disaster, repeaters may not be operational
    and AC power may be out.</li>

  <li>Are you prepared to operate self-sufficiently for several hours or days?</li>

  <li>Start an EMRG emergency kit.

    <ul>
      <li>It could be a box, kit bag, or old briefcase.</li>
      <li>In an emergency you'll have the basics in one spot.</li>
      <li>Review your emergency kit and add to it over time.</li>
      <li>You don't have to fill it up the first time you use it.</li>
      <li>You'll add to it as you get to know what is needed.</li>
    </ul>

  </li>

</ul>

<p>The following information is meant to get us thinking about what we have and what we need to have
ready within minutes if we are called to assist in an emergency.
</p>

<h2>Small Personal First Aid Kit</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Aspirin plus Tylenol/Advil or similar pain relief items</li>
  <li>Antiseptic powder, one or more clean triangular bandages</li>
  <li>Band-Aids etc. for cuts, scrapes, or burns</li>
  <li>A roll or two of white, medical adhesive tape</li>
  <li>Scissors, tweezers, small pliers</li>
  <li>Safety pins. Several sizes of them are useful for many things.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personal Writing Supplies</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Clipboard, preferably with a weatherproof cover</li>
  <li>Pens, pencils, and pencil sharpener</li>
  <li>Notepad and writing paper</li>
  <li>EMRG memo forms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Required Radio Supplies</h2>

<h3>Handheld Radio</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Spare NiCad pack</li>
  <li>AA battery holder</li>
  <li>External batteries with adapter cords</li>
  <li>Power adapter for using the handheld in the car.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Headphones</h3>

<ul>
  <li>They are necessary for working in and around noisy locations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Radio Supplies</h2>

<h3>Antennas</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Build or buy spare antennas for an emergency.</li>

  <li>Start with a simple 2 meter 1/4 wave mounted on an inverted connector
  or try building a J-pole or roll-up J-pole.</li>

  <li>Over time, you can add antennas because you want to have several spares,
  or you've got or built better antennas, or you need them for other bands.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Antenna Support Structures</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Keep some pipe or other type of mast available.</li>

  <li>You can use a mast to mount an antenna above local obstacles.
  Often this mast does not need to be very high. Consider this fact: a 1/4 wave antenna
  mounted on top of a 10' high section of mast will always outperform a rubber duckie.</li>

  <li>This mast can be a 5' length of pipe up to an elaborate collapsing multi-section mast.
  Handyman's tip: A threaded electrical pipe that is cut in the centre can be coupled together
  makes an easy-to-carry 10' mast section.</li>

  <li>Also, three or four concrete blocks can help to support the mast and keep it vertical.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Batteries</h3>

<ul>

  <li>They are needed for things such as AM/FM radios, flashlights, handhelds or portables.
  Try to have Alkaline batteries on hand. NiCads always discharge themselves over time.</li>

  <li>If you have NiCads, pack a battery charger to go along with them. Others may need it, too.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Coax</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Keep a length of coax to go with the antenna; about 20' to 30' is enough to start.
  This length allows the antenna to be outside and the operator to be inside ;-)</li>

  <li>If you get more coax later, you can add it to your collection.</li>

  <li>Also, an extra 50' to 100' of heavy coax has its uses.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Miscellaneous Operating Supplies</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Copy of radio licenses</li>
  <li>Maps of the area</li>
  <li>Pocket knife</li>
  <li>Kleenex</li>
  <li>Electrical tape</li>
  <li>Duct tape; it's good for many things</li>
  <li>Handful of plastic wire ties/wraps</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other TIPS</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Carry a spare set of car keys.</li>

  <li>Keep your car's gas tank up on the <b>full</b> side of half a tank.</li>

  <li>Gas stations may not be open or they may be out of service in an emergency.</li>

  <li>Use only the (LOW)est power levels required for clean communication.
  Low power use extends battery life and reduces interference with other radios in the area.</li>

  <li>Label your belongings with your call sign, etc.
  Labels helps people return your stuff to you after an emergency has passed, i.e. coax.</li>

</ul>
