When dealing with local organizations such as hospitals, fire
departments
or municipal emergency planners, regarding permanent radio
installations,
there is always the question of what is required and how much will it
cost.
For example a local fire department wants to have a permanent amateur
radio
installation at a fire station.
<p>There are several options, depending on just how prepared an
organization
wants to be. Typically
the goal is to find an antenna that is simple, long lasting and
economical.
</p>
<p>Some of the questions are:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) What is a good all purpose
antenna for installation at a site
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such as
an EOC or fire station?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Should it be a dual band or
single band antenna?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Who should do the installation?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) Is height a good thing or a
bad thing?
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>By far, the most popular antenna for a permanent emergency
installation,
is the Sinclair 210-C. This is a very durable single loop VHF antenna
which
covers 138 to 174 Mhz. There are other antennas in this family, the
210-C2
and 210-C4 are popular for commercial and repeater use. The wide
bandwidth
capability, makes the antenna very appealing, because it can be used
for
commercial and amateur frequencies.
</p>
<p>Dual band antennas are great for installations where operating two
radios
on different nets is a requirement. In Ottawa, there are several
Diamond
200A dual band and 3200A tri-band base antennas which have been
installed
for over 10 years and they are still working well. Some people have
reported
problems with dual band antennas failing early in there life, due to
the
design and the affects of wind loading.
</p>
<p>When it comes to installation of the antennas there are three
choices:
<br>
1) Have the installation done by professionals. This will cost more
money for the agency paying for the antenna, but it resolves the issues
of liability. In many cases, the group paying for the radio already has
a commercial radio shop who does work on their existing antennas. The
problem
with commercial companies, is that they don't always do a good job and
corrective action is often required later.
<br>
2) Have the installation done by professionals, but ensure that your
radio group has someone knowledgeable involved to oversee the
installation.
This helps to point out problems during the installation when then can
be corrected more easily.
<br>
3) Have the local radio group install the antenna. Based on past
history
and relationships, this may be an acceptable solution. Beware that
there
are
liability issues, during the installation (what if you put a hole in
the
roof)&nbsp; and once the antenna is installed (what is lightning starts
a fire).
</p>
<p>Antenna location is an important issue. Having the highest antenna
may
not be a great idea, unless you have a radio with great intermod
rejection
capability. The purpose of the antenna will help decide how high it
needs
to be. Local repeater use may succeed well, with a simple antenna at
roof
level.

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><b><u>Simple &amp;
Cheap Pocket Quarter Wave Antenna</u></b>
<br>
The following link shows a simple quarter wave antenna made using an
inverted SO239 chassis connector. This is a common antenna shown in
many
antenna books. The antenna can be used for 146, 225 or 445 MHz.
<p><a href="http://www.caryncrepeater.com/images/WX_Radio_Antenna1.JPG">http://www.caryncrepeater.com/images/WX_Radio_Antenna1.JPG</a>
</p>
<p>Use #12 electrical wire for the radials and the vertical portion.
This
wire can be purchased by the metre (foot) at hardware stores as 2/12
house
wire, you will need 2M ( 4 to 6 feet). Remove the outer insulation so
you
have a white wire, black wire and the ground.
</p>
<p>Build the antenna as shown, cutting it for the 146 Mhz lengths. You
can make the antenna with three wires for radials and 1 for the
vertical,
or you can use all 4 holes in the SO239 connector and make 4 radials if
you want.
</p>
<p>Use a round form such as a piece of pipe about 3/4 to 1" diameter
and
roll up each of the wires, starting at the outer end of each wire,
rolling
it into the centre. When you are done, the antenna looks like a bunch
of
coils attached to the connector. While you need big pockets to store
this
in, it doesn't take up much space and is ready to be straightened out
in
an emergency. Keep the 225 and 445 lengths with the antenna, so you can
always cut it in the field if required for a different band.
</p>
<p>For mounting the antenna, use a short length of 3/4 PVC (white)
plumbing
pipe. If you cut a&nbsp; 10 cm (4 to 6") slot in the end of the pipe, a
PL259 will slide in and the cable will exit through the slot. Just
attach
the cable to the antenna, slide the PL259 into the pipe and then attach
the pipe to something.
</p>
<p>You can enhance this antenna with a simple extension mast, colored
wire
etc.
</p>
<p>(I'll try to add a picture in the future)
