<br>In dealing with local organizations regarding permanent installations,
there is always the question of what is required. When it comes to cable
for connecting to the antenna, a purest would calculate the losses associated
with RG-213 versus 1/2 or 7/8 inch heliax and then compare the cost of
more power and preamps versus changing the feeders to a lower loss variety.
,&nbsp; There are formulas and calculations, but what are some good "rules
of thumb" that can be put to paper.

<blockquote><b>VHF</b>
<br>Up to 100 feet - RG-213
<br>Over 100 feet - 1/2 inch heliax
<p>UHF
<br>Up to 50 feet - RG-213
<br>Over 50 feet - 7/8 inch heliax</blockquote>
Quite often the connectors are the big problem. A set of connectors can
easily exceed the cost of the heliax for short runs. There is a new type
of heliax called LMR which is much cheaper with only a very minor performance
loss and the connectors are cheaper as well.
<p>A second rule of thumb, for UHF type N connectors are essential and
preferred, but not truly essential for VHF, where in a pinch you can get
by with type UHF (PL-259).
