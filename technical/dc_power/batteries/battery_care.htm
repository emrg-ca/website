<p><b><font face="Arial">INTRODUCTION</font></b>
</p>
<dir>
<dir><font face="Arial">Whether for remote operation, backpacking,
special
events or emergency use, there is a size and capacity of battery&nbsp;
to fit all applications. What you do once you buy a battery will
determine
its useful life. Besides physical abuse, the two things that shorten
battery
life are over charging and under charging.</font>
<p><font face="Arial">Gel Cell batteries are often used as a portable
power
source in ham radio. There are many sources for gel cell batteries,
from
flea markets to alarm supply stores to electronics specialty outlets.
The
price, size and condition will vary greatly.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial">The "gel cell" is a sealed lead acid battery. The
electrolyte (acid) is stabilized by combining it with a gelling agent
or
by using an absorbent plate separator. This type of battery can usually
be stored, used, charged and discharged in any position.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Some lead acid batteries are designed with a
plate
size imbalance or a catalyst, to help control gas generation and to aid
in deep cycle recharging. These are known as "deep cycle" batteries.
This
type of battery is often associated with Marine use, where some
batteries
offer boat engine starting capacity and deep cycle capacity.</font></p>

<p><br>
<b><font face="Arial">DOES AND DON&#8217;TS</font></b>
</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <font face="Arial">Do Not charge batteries in a sealed container.
ALL lead
acid batteries, including gel cells, can produce hydrogen gasses.</font></li>
    <li>
      <font face="Arial">Do Not use an automotive type battery charger
for gel
cells. The output voltage is too high and will overcharge the battery.
Overcharging shortens battery life.</font></li>
    <li>
      <font face="Arial">Do Not store a battery in a car in hot
weather, under
direct sunlight, in front of a stove or near a fire.</font></li>
    <li>
      <font face="Arial">Do Not carry the battery by the terminal
connections.</font></li>
    <li>
      <font face="Arial">Do Not charge a battery beyond the time
specified (if
using the cycle method). If the battery is not fully charged even after
being charged for a time longer than specified, discontinue charging
and
remove the battery from the charger.</font></li>
    <li>
      <font face="Arial">Do Not discharge A 12 volt battery below about
10.5
to 10.7 volts (1.75 volts per cell x 6 cells). Sealed lead acid
batteries
will generally not tolerate repeated deep discharges.</font></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <font face="Arial">Always charge a new battery before use</font></li>
    <li>
      <font face="Arial">Always Install insulation covers on terminals
to prevent
shorts.</font></li>
    <li>
      <font face="Arial">Always install a fuse in the cable connecting
to the
battery, to protect the battery and cable from shorts. Install the fuse
on the battery end of the cable.</font></li>
    <li>
      <font face="Arial">Always keep the battery clean.</font></li>
    <li>
      <font face="Arial">Always charge a battery that has not been used
for a
long time. The battery gradually loses its capacity due to self
discharge
during storage. Periods over which the battery can be stored without
charging
are given below in relation to storage temperatures:</font></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <font face="Arial">Below 20<sup>o</sup>C 9 months</font></li>
      <li>

<b><font face="Arial">CHARGING</font></b>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote><font face="Arial">There are two considerations for
charging
a battery; how to charge it quickly and how to keep it charged. Before
building or buying any battery charger, get a volt meter first. The
only
way to know what is really happening with the battery, is to measure
the
voltage levels. This is important over time, to ensure that the charger
is operating properly and to detect battery deterioration.</font>
    <p><font face="Arial">Rapid charging of a battery requires a lot of
user
care or a charger designed for rapid charging. Batteries can be damaged
if they are charged to fast or too long. Rapid chargers monitor the
charging
rate and voltage, and adjust the charging current during the charge
cycle.&nbsp;
Some chargers are designed to go into maintenace mode once the battery
is fully charged which ensures that the battery is not overcharged, but
is always ready when required.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Keeping a battery charged, ready for use, can
be
accomplished in several ways. This same charger can typcally be used to
charge the battery as well, it just does it slowly, so it may take a
day
or more to reach a fully charged state. It is critical to understand
the
limits of your battery to ensure that the battery is not overcharged.</font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Arial">There are two options described in this
document;
build/buy a charger or use a regulated power supply with an adapter.

charged to its maximum capacity and is then removed from the charger.
The
battery is connected to a load when required, which will discharge the
battery. The discharged voltage of the battery should not go below 10.5
to 10.7 volts (1.75 volts per cell x 6 cells).</font>

<p><font face="Arial">When the battery is discharged, it is connected
to
the charger and is charged once again. The maximum charging voltage is
14.5 to 14.9 volts, depending on temperature (See table below). <b>The
typical value to use is 14.7 volts, which is the charge voltage at 25<sup>o</sup>C</b>.

<p><u><font face="Arial">Float Use</font></u>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial">The float use method is often mixed with the
trickle
charge method, because both types use the same charging style. Float
use
means that the battery is permanently installed in the circuit with the
load and the power supply/charger. When the power supply/charger fails,
the batteries supply the power. This method is used by the telephone
company
to ensure that the phone system is always working.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Trickle charging is associated with a battery
that
is not connected to a load, but has a charger attached. The battery
must
be connected to the load when required. The charger is just that, a
charger
and is not capable of supplying power to the load. When the battery is
attached to the load, the charger is removed.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial">The important difference of the float use method
over the cycle use method, is that in the float use method, the battery
is charged to a voltage that is below the maximum volts per cell for
the
battery. The typical float voltage is 13.4 to 14.1 volts, depending on
temperature (See table below). <b>The typical value to use is 13.7
