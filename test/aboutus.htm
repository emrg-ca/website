WHO WE ARE<br>
      </span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;">EMRG is not a club
or a social group. EMRG is an organization that provides a single point
of contact to access trained volunteer Amateur radio operators in <st1:city
 w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:place></st1:city>. Amateur
radio operators in <st1:city w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:city>, the City of <st1:city
 w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:city>, the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the
Hospitals and Radio Amateurs of Canada, all recognize EMRG as the
organization providing Amateur radio emergency communications in <st1:city
 w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:place></st1:city>. The City
of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:place></st1:city>
maintains an excellent relationship with EMRG, providing funding, radio
repeater sites, equipment, equipment storage and meeting rooms. <a

WHAT WE DO<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">The main role for EMRG is to
provide <strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">radio communications
      </span></strong>in an emergency to organizations involved in
humanitarian response, who do not have a radio system, lack capacity on
any radio communications they have, or who normally rely on phones and
cell phones. The three main humanitarian response groups in the city of
Ottawa are;<br>
      </span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">City of Ottawa, Community
Services Department</span> </li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ottawa Red Cross</span> </li>
        <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">Salvation Army</span> </li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span
 style="font-family: Arial;">As part of the humanitarian response, EMRG
radio communications would be used to link shelters, mobile care teams
and community patrols, with key sites such as the City of Ottawa
Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), the Community Services Command
Centre, the Ottawa Red Cross Headquarters and the Salvation Army.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><span
 style="font-family: Arial;">EMRG is NOT a back up for the hundreds of
radios used daily by Police, Fire and Paramedics. The capacity required
to replace their radio systems is beyond the limits of what Amateur
radio can supply. Police, Fire and Paramedics have no plans to use EMRG
as a backup communications solution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

MEMBERSHIP
REQUIREMENTS</o:p><br>
There are no special requirements to participate in EMRG, other than an
interest to help and a valid Amateur radio license. One of the purposes
of EMRG is to provide training and an opportunity for Amateurs to share
information, so new amateurs can participate effectively alongside long
time operators. Each EMRG member brings the equipment they can share in
an emergency. Some sites have permanent radio equipment installed and
EMRG is building a small supply of radios, so even Amateurs with a
license but no equipment can still play an important role. <span>&nbsp;</span><a

MUTUAL AID&nbsp;</span></b>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In a
sustained emergency EMRG would not be able to provide sufficient
resources to operate 24 hours a day for an extended period of time.
Depending on the emergency, local Amateurs may be part of the
population impacted, reducing the number of EMRG volunteers available
to deploy. In the event that additional resources are
required, EMRG has a Mutual Aid agreement with neighbouring <a
 href="http://www.emrg.ca/ares.htm">ARES</a> (Amateur Radio Emergency
Service) groups
and meets on a yearly basis to improve mutual aid process and
standards.
Additional Amateurs can also be brought in from further away if
required. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

PLANNING AND PREPARATION<o:p></o:p></span></strong><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">Amateur radio is known around
the world for its role in providing communications in times of
disaster. In order to provide effective communications, Amateur radio
operators must be prepared and trained to be able to provide that high
level of service. Without planning, training and practice, Amateurs are
just volunteers with a radio. Like any activity, creating an effective
team takes more than a group of people with a common interest and
skills. <a href="http://www.emrg.ca/test/planning.htm">EMRG Planning
Information</a> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p>Creating
an effective communications team that can deploy quickly, providing
communications solutions that work, starts with the average amateur
radio operator, but also requires the following components; </span></p>
      <ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
        <li class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Relationships</span></b><span
 style="font-family: Arial;"> with the agencies and organizations that
use volunteer communications. In an emergency, people use what they
know and trust. Relationships take time, but demonstrate commitment and
allow an opportunity to demonstrate skills and build trust. <o:p></o:p></span>
        </li>
        <li class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Training</span></b><span
 style="font-family: Arial;"> to understand how to communicate
effectively under emergency conditions. Net control for an emergency is
much different than the local weekly nets. Not all Amateurs know
everything about radio operation. <span>&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span>
        </li>
        <li class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Organization
and structure</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;"> so key
leadership roles are in place and understood by Amateurs radio
operators and the client organizations being served. Someone must be in
charge, so Amateurs know who to follow and clients know who has
control. <o:p></o:p></span> </li>
        <li class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Personal
Preparedness</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;"> to ensure
that the right personal and radio equipment is available and can be
packed quickly. Clothing for several days is important, as is the
ability to operate from multiple power sources, or to operate from
locations without any communications infrastructure. <o:p></o:p></span>
        </li>
        <li class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Communications
Preparedness</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;"> to ensure
that the infrastructure in the area will be able to support emergency
communications. If some areas have no repeater coverage and the other
areas have repeaters without backup power, the communications
effectiveness will be low. <o:p></o:p></span> </li>
        <li class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Practice</span></b><span
 style="font-family: Arial;"> is key to anything from sports to
volunteer radio communications. Practice sharpens skills, points our
areas to work on and identifies problems to solve in order to make the
groups capabilities stronger. <o:p></o:p></span> </li>
        <li class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Planning</span></b><span
 style="font-family: Arial;"> is required to ensure that the group
forms into a team, that the communications requirements are understood
and that solutions are in place to meet those requirements. <o:p></o:p></span></li>

EMRG IN THE COMMUNITY<o:p></o:p></span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;">The EMRG
approach to Amateur radio as an Emergency Communications resource is
based on a current and realistic view of what is required and what
Amateur radio can provide. EMRG works to educate the Amateur radio
population to the requirements for Amateur radio when providing
emergency communications, through presentations at local Amateur radio
clubs, the EMRG website and displays at local hamfests. <o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span
 style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p>Communications
for local events such as walk-a-thons, ski races, soccer tournaments,
etc, is often provided by the local amateurs, typically through one of
the amateur radio clubs. EMRG is typically not involved in these events
directly because most clubs have a history of working with specific
events and the clubs draw from the same pool of local amateurs to
provide the communications. Many EMRG members participate in these
events, which is encouraged by EMRG because it is an excellent learning
opportunity. <o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span
 style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p>In 2007,
EMRG provided communications for the Tour Nortel. This is an important
addition for EMRG, because public service communications provides an
excellent training opportunity for amateur radio operators to perfect
operational skills and develop equipment improvements. <o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>

EMRG HISTORY<o:p></o:p></span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;">The role
of volunteer radio communications in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:place></st1:city> began back in the 1950s and
early 60s. EMO (Emergency Management Organizations) were set up at the
national, provincial and municipal levels. Equipment was put in place
for emergency use, to link agencies within a municipality and to link
municipalities. <o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span
 style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p>In 1963
the XM49 Emergency Radio Squadron (XM49ers) was enlisted by the local
EMO coordinator for the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton, as a
way to expand the base of radio operators in the event of an emergency.
EMO provided courses in First Aid and CPR as well as training
exercises. In 1966 the XM49ers assisted during the <st1:street
 w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Heron Road</st1:address></st1:street>
bridge collapse. <o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span
 style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p>The
XM49ers were using General Radio Service (GRS) communications, often
referred to as CB. In 1980, amateur radio VHF repeaters were available
in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:place></st1:city>
and a group was formed called the Emergency Measures Amateur Radio
Group (EMARG). This expanded the base of radio operators in the Region
and provided communications using repeaters. <o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span
 style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;">In 1990, the present
organization, the Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) was formed.
Today, all EMRG members have an Amateur radio license. <o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span
 style="font-weight: normal; font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p>In 1999,
Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC), the National Amateur Radio
organization, appointed the EMRG Team Leader as the ARES EC for <st1:city
 w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:place></st1:city>. ARES
(Amateur Radio Emergency Service) is a Nationally recognized
organization under which many Amateur radio emergency communications
groups are organized. Appointing the EMRG Team Leader as the Emergency
Coordinator (EC) for ARES in the City of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:place></st1:city> brought the ARES name and
organization into the National Capital. Being part of ARES broadened
the recognition of EMRG as the local volunteer Amateur radio emergency
communications group, while not changing the role or responsibilities
for EMRG. The control of EMRG remains with the EMRG Team Leader,
however the group now has two names, EMRG and Ottawa ARES.<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p>

EMRG RADIO NETWORK<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></b><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">One major advantage of Amateur
radio is the many frequencies available for use. These frequencies are
assigned in bands of frequencies rather than as individual channels.
These frequency bands have different advantages such as local
communications using VHF and UHF or long distance using HF. EMRGs local
communications is based on VHF and UHF radios, similar to those used by
commercial services such as taxis or Fire Departments. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p>Amateur
radio repeaters are used to extend the range over which radio
communications can reach. It is also possible to operate without the
repeaters, which is important in an emergency where repeaters may have
failed. <span>&nbsp;</span><a
 href="http://www.emrg.ca/test/repeaters.htm">EMRG Repeater information</a>
      <o:p></o:p></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When
establishing an emergency communications network, EMRG can establish
multiple local communication networks, each with their own frequency.
These local networks can be linked together through a wide area
communications network on still another band or frequency.<br>
