      <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">INTRODUCTION<o:p></o:p></span></b><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">Data Communications and the
EMRG view of how it will be provided, have changed significantly over
the last few years. EMRG and Amateur radio in general used always used
the name Packet Radio, which meant Data Communications, since packet
radio was really the only option.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Things
have changed and now there are numerous modern software applications,
and new digital transmission technologies. Packet Radio is still used,
but it is now viewed as just a transmission technology, a connectivity
solution or pipe from point a to b, not the whole solution in itself.
The days of typing commands on a dumb terminal are gone. Modern
software applications hide the back end<br>
technical aspect of packet radio, providing a user friendly, email like
interface that almost anyone can use with no training.<br>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">These
modern software applications allow multiple types of digital
transmission technologies to co-exist, allowing seamless integration
and maximization of Amateur radio equipment and infrastructure.<br>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EMRG DATA COMMUNICATIONS
PRESENTATIONS</span><br>
There are several EMRG presentations that provide an idea of what EMRG
is doing with data communications.<br>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><a
 name="dataplan"></a><br>
      <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">EMRG DATA COMMUNICATIONS
PLAN</span></big><br>
There is no single data communications solution that meets all the
needs and expectations for EMRG. For this reason, the EMRG Data
Communications Service is made up of two parallel, yet integrated
solutions.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. EMRG Basic Data Communications</span><br>
Basic Data Communications service can be summarized as text based,
using Outpost as the end user application, connecting to a TNC BBS.
Outpost with a TNC BBS provides simplicity, making it easier to keep
working if a disaster has impacted EMRG infrastructure. <br>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Basic data
communications is easy to deploy as a portable solution, requiring only
a radio and TNC, plus it allows EMRG to provide Mutual Aid for Renfrew
County West ARES where this solution is also being used.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. EMRG Enhanced Data
Communications</span><br>
Enhanced Data Communications Service can be summarized as using Winlink
to provide email capability with attachments, using an Internet
connection and local routing if the Internet connection fails. The
Winlink system provides much greater capabilities, while requiring more
complex network support. <br>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Enhanced
data communications allows communications through email to locations
with Internet access and allows EMRG to provide Mutual Aid for
neighbouring ARES groups who are using the Winlink system.<br>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">MORE INFORMATION WILL BE ADDED AS WE HAVE
TIME<br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></p>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUPPORT FOR AGW PACKET ENGINE</span><br>
Support for AGW Packet Engine is required to provide shared access over
wired or wireless LAN. This is essential for EMRG computers in key
sites such as EMRG Communications Room, Red Cross and the EOC. <br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is also a possible solution for shelter
deployment<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The end user software (Outpost, Paclink, RMS
Packet) does not work directly with all TNCs, while AGW Packet Engine
works with a large set of TNCs.<br>
      <br>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><a name="DSTAR"></a><span
 style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      <big>DSTAR</big></span><br>
DSTAR is the ICOM proprietary data communications network that can
provide low speed data on VHF or UHF and high speed (128kb) data on 1.2
GHz. There are many stories within Amateur radio about the need for
high speed data communications capability for emergency communications,
and some of these stories may be true. It is important to separate
client requirements from the Amateur urge to deploy new technology.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The issue
with DSTAR is not whether
it is good or bad, rather it is whether a group has a requirement for
which DSTAR is the best technical and most economical solution. For
EMRG there is currently no requirement for high speed data, and for low
speed
data, 1200 baud packet radio meets EMRG requirements at a much lower
cost. One of the common stories used to justify high speed data using
DStar refers to the need to send pictures so emergency officials can
respond to situations. In reality, emergency officials will not wait
for a picture to react, nor would a picture be of great assistance in
assessing the stability of a dam for example. <br>
      <br>
      </span></p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DSTAR - PACKET COST COMPARISON</span>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Icom has
produced a <a href="http://www.icomcanada.com/dstar/dstar7.htm">fact
sheet</a> comparing the costs of DSTAR with packet radio. The
comparison is very simplistic, assuming everything is purchased new and
ignoring the need to interface with applications to create a useful
data communications solution.<br>
For low speed data, even if new equipment is purchased the costs for
1200 B packet is still lower than DStar. Compare a TNC ($250) + VHF/UHF
dual band mobile radio ($300), with the cost of a DV DStar VHF/UHF dual
band mobile ($660). Now add in the cost of a digital repeater, plus a
second for redundancy. With packet, a digital repeater is a TNC +
radio, so the cost is $550. What is the cost for a VHF or UHF DStar
repeater?<br>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In Ottawa
there are a limited number of DStar radio owners, so any use of DStar
must include backup radios in the cost. For packet, any VHF or UHF
radio can be used and there are lots of radios available, so no new
backup radios are required.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">MUTUAL AID</span><br>
There is one DStar repeater, located in Ottawa. Any use of DStar
through a repeater would be limited to Ottawa and since neighbouring
groups are using packet, there is no compatibility. While there may be
a situation where DStar point to point links could be used for Mutual
Aid, DStar is a lot of work and expense for a solution that is
potentially not useful.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">REPEATER DURABILITY</span><br>
There is only 1 DStar repeater in Ottawa and the long term
survivability of this system, its ownership group and its survivability
in an emergency is not known at this time.&nbsp; Some basic items to
know for an emergency repeater is whether the repeater is on backup
generator power and would the site be refuelled in an emergency?<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DSTAR POTENTIAL</span><br>
For EMRG the potential of DStar is for high speed backbone links.&nbsp;
There is no 9600 Baud packet equipment in Ottawa, so any use of speeds
higher than 1200B packet would require a new TNC ($600) plus a new
radio ($300) and there are limited radios available that support 9600
Baud. The cost of a DStar 1.2 GHz radio is about $1000, so it is cost
competitive with 9600 Baud packet, however the DStar radio can provide
much higher throughput.There is no requirement for high speed backbone
links at this time, so little thought has been put into how they might
be configured. It might be a point to point link, connecting packet
digipeaters, or it might go through the DStar repeater. <br>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">For now
the focus of EMRG is to create a working, deployable solution. This
includes end user applications, intermediate servers and access
solutions for large sealed buildings. Over time, clients may see
opportunities to use the data communications solution and if the
throughput of packet is not sufficient, then DStar may be a solution to
enhance the service by increasing the speed of some components in the
system.<br>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><a
 name="APRS"></a><br>
      <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">APRS</span></big><br>
APRS (Automatic Position Reporting System) is often included in
discussions about data communications, based on it’s text message
capability and the GPS tracking. <br>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">GPS TRACKING</span><br>
The GPS tracking capability could be useful for monitoring vehicles
that do not have an amateur radio operator, such as a delivery truck or
Red Cross team in the field. To be effective, this would require EMRG
having several tracker kits ready to deploy, with the radio, GPS and
TNC built into a small case only requiring the external antennas and DC
power. <br>
Based on current work load and priorities, EMRG has no plans to
implement APRS tracking capability in the near future.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">TEXT MESSAGES</span><br>
EMRG has no plans utilize APRS text message capability. The requirement
for sending text based messages is for larger volumes of information.
There are also issues of network congestion and end user equipment that
would need to be resolved.<br>
      <br>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><a
 name="handhelddevice"></a><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">HANDHELD DEVICES</span><br>
There are many hand held devices available today that can provide email
capability, often called a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant). Many of
these support some type of interface such as a serial port, WiFi or
Bluetooth, that can allow the hand held device to interface with an
Amateur radio data communications solution. While this is an
interesting application, there is no requirement at this time to
deliver data to these types of devices. <br>
      <br>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><a
 name="otherapps"></a><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">PACKET APPLICATIONS THAT ARE NOT
USED<br>
      </span>There are several applications still currently in use and
in some cases being updated for packet radio networks. These particular
applications have been considered by EMRG and are not considered useful
for EMRG at this time, either due to not having a requirement and the
complexity and effort to build and configure the network.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">WINPAC</span><br>
Winpac was a very popular as a packet client with BBS interfacing.
Winpac is no longer supported, and does not have an email like user
interface, so EMRG will not include Winpac.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">PC BBS</span><br>
There are several BBS applications written for the PC, starting back in
the DOS era. The most notable is FBB6, which was originally created for
DOS, and later updated for Windows. Implementing a BBS on a PC requires
more hardware, which is hardware the requires more power and there is
additional complexity to implement and manage the BBS. EMRG will focus
on the TNC BBS due to its low power, simplicity and portability.<br>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">BPQ Switch</span><br>
BPQ is a PC application that allows packet channel switching. The user
connects to the BPQ site using packet radio and then can select
channels to connect to. This allows links on other bands or speeds to
multiple BBS or other destinations. Written originally for DOS, there
are now windows versions and interfaces for AGWPE. While an interesting
component, it requires much greater user skill and understanding. The
EMRG plan is built on simplicity where radio connections are as direct
as possible and not dependent on the type of radio link, so
implementing a switch for packet radio is not required or desirable.<br>
