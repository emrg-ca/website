HOW TO BECOME AN
EMRG MEMBER</span></o:p><br>
To become an EMRG member you can fill out the <a
 href="http://www.emrg.ca/EMRG-504_Membership_Form.pdf">EMRG
membership form</a> and mail it, or hand it in at an EMRG meeting. You
may
want to attend an <a href="http://www.emrg.ca/meeting_general.htm">EMRG
meeting</a> first to get
a better understanding of EMRG before joining. Joining EMRG is making a
commitment, so there
is nothing wrong with taking some time to gather information to see
what you
think, before making a decision.<o:p></o:p></span> </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It is
understood that people
have family and work commitments, so no one is available all the time,
however
not participating in anything adds no value to EMRG. Please do not sign
up just
to put your name on the list.<br>
      <br>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;"><a
 name="sills"></a><br>
SKILLS
REQUIRED<o:p></o:p></span></b><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">There are no special
requirements to be an EMRG member. You DO NOT need to own a radio, You
DO NOT
need radio operating experience, and you DO NOT need technical skills.
All that
is required is an Amateur radio license and a willingness to
participate to the
best of your availability. There are no dues for membership.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p>The
most important resource
for EMRG is people. There are permanent radios at key sites, EMRG has a
supply
of radios and there are Amateurs with radios they will lend in an
emergency.
Training and exercises help develop skills and confidence and new
members are
partnered with existing members to gain experience. No one is sent to
do an
assignment unless they feel confident about what they are being
requested to do
and agree to do it. There is nothing wrong with saying “I’m not
comfortable
doing that job”.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The most
important skills a
new member can bring are the skills they use everyday. Preparing for
and delivering Emergency Communications requires a broad range of
skills,
including organization, writing, planning, doing routine radio checks,
creating
or delivering training, inventory, helping paint, carrying things,
cleaning up
and just otherwise being there when needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
there are some technical projects and certainly those skills can be
useful,
most technical work is done prior to an event, not during.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="updateprocess"></a><br>
MEMBERSHIP
UPDATE PROCESS</span><br>
The EMRG membership process requires each and every member to send a
letter, email, or make a phone call, to the membership co-ordinator
once per year, in the fall (Sept/Oct) to renew their membership. If the
membership co-ordinator does not hear from a member, their name is
moved to the next level of membership. The membership co-ordinator will
attempt to contact the person to make sure that the change is desired
by the member.</o:p></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>EMRG
members must not assume that because they know the membership
co-ordinator they should automatically updated on the list. Even the
team leader has to send in a notification for update. The update is
also a good time to note any changes such as address, phone number or
email address. This process ensures that names are removed from the
membership list if the person does not fill out an updated form so the
list does not grow with the names of people who have moved away or are
no longer interested in EMRG.<br>

HOW
MANY MEMBERS IN EMRG<o:p></o:p></span></b><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">EMRG has 50 members, of
which about 25 participate regularly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over
the years various methods were used to contact and
interest local
Amateurs in EMRG. Eventually it was realized that volunteerism in
Amateur radio
is no different than the rest of the population, only a small group of
people
have this particular interest. Amateurs who are not involved in
emergency
communications are busy assisting with local clubs, RAC the national
amateur
organization, expanding different facets of the hobby, or just being
the large
pool of users who make it viable for manufacturers to build equipment
for
Amateurs to use.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p>While
it is recognized that
there is no big pool of new members waiting to be tapped, work must
continue to
contact and attract new members, as a few leave each year, so new
members are
required just to maintain existing levels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;
      <br>
      </o:p></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;"><a
 name="volunteersinemergency"></a><br>
VOLUNTEERS
IN AN EMERGENCY<o:p></o:p></span></b><br>
      <span style="font-family: Arial;">Like the general population,
Amateurs want to help when an emergency or disaster happens.
Unfortunately,
untrained Amateurs are just volunteers with a radio.<span style="">&nbsp;
      </span>Without training, Amateurs do not understand
the role of EMRG, who is in charge, operating procedures or equipment
operation. Some operating locations are in secure facilities, while
shelters
are filled with vulnerable people. An emergency is not the time or
place to
send people who have unknown skills and backgrounds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>EMRG
will use some new
volunteers in an emergency by partnering them with EMRG members. The
primary
source of assistance for EMRG in an emergency is <a
 href="ARESMutualAid.jpg">Mutual Aid with neighbouring
ARES groups</a>. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
