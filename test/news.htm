      <span style="font-family: Arial;">I recently had someone ask me
the following question:&nbsp; "What information or items are required
in the event that there is an EMRG deployment (What do I need to
bring?). " <a href="news2008-12-21a.htm">more</a><span

      </span>An Amateur wrote to me the other day saying that they were
not clear on
what exactly EMRG would do in an emergency. Looking through the web
site, listening to us talk about the need for re-organization of EMRG
and the recent posting about terrorism on the email list, left this
person with no clear view in their head. It is questions like this that
help me see where we are, or are not. I have been dealing with this for
so long at an intense level that it all seems very clear to me, but
people can't read my mind, so I thought I should provide a short
summary. <a href="news2008-12-06a.htm">more</a><br>

At the meeting on Saturday I mentioned that we will be
signing a new agreement with the City of Ottawa, and today I actually
signed the new agreement. <a href="news2008-12-02a.htm">more</a><br>

When it comes to Emergency Preparedness we expect our various levels of
Government to have solid plans to deal with emergencies and disasters,
and we expect them to include Amateur radio in those plans.&nbsp; RAC
and the ARRL have concluded that the main potential for Amateur radio
to demonstrate value in the eyes of government is through the service
provided by Emergency Communications. <a href="news2008-11-30a.htm">more</a><br>
