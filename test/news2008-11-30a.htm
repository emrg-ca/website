full OARC Groundwave newsletter is available <a

      <br>
This is the first of a series of EMRG – Ottawa ARES Emergency
Communications articles in the Groundwave, thanks to the continued
support of the OARC. As much as possible I plan to keep the articles
focused on emergency communications, rather than EMRG – Ottawa ARES
specifically, to make them educational and interesting for all Amateurs.<br>
      <br>
What is the value of groups like EMRG – Ottawa ARES?<br>
      <br>
When it comes to Emergency Preparedness we expect our various levels of
Government to have solid plans to deal with emergencies and disasters,
and we expect them to include Amateur radio in those plans.&nbsp; RAC
and the ARRL have concluded that the main potential for Amateur radio
to demonstrate value in the eyes of government is through the service
provided by Emergency Communications.<br>
      <br>
Saying that Amateurs are great people and will do great things if
called, is not something that a Municipality can write into their
Emergency Plan.&nbsp; Emergency Planners are looking for organized
groups that have contact information, understand what is required and
have developed solutions to meet those needs. In other words, they are
looking for dependability, reliability, and demonstrated
sustainability, which is what EMRG provides for Amateurs in Ottawa.<br>
      <br>
Like the general population, Amateurs want to help when an emergency or
disaster happens. Unfortunately there is nothing in the Amateur
licensing process that prepares Amateurs for emergencies. Without
training, Amateurs do not understand their role, who is in charge,
operating procedures or equipment operation. Some operating locations
are in secure facilities, while shelters are filled with vulnerable
people, many of them children. An emergency is not the time or place to
send people who have unknown skills and backgrounds. <br>
      <br>
EMRG will absorb some walk in volunteers in an emergency by partnering
them with EMRG members, but the primary source of assistance in an
emergency is Mutual Aid from neighbouring ARES groups.<br>
      <br>
Amateur radio emergency communications is a team event. It takes a
group of people planning, preparing, testing and practicing in order to
deliver effective communications solutions. Providing that level of
organization and activity takes a lot of people. You don’t have to join
EMRG – Ottawa ARES to help. You may be able to provide support for a
task that needs an owner, or make a cash or equipment donation. <br>
      <br>
The OARC is a great example of supporting EMRG, while not being part of
EMRG. The club has stepped up their support with the donation of a TNC
for EMRG Red Cross communications, plus other support such as this
article in the Groundwave, prominently displaying the EMRG logo and
offers to have an EMRG – Ottawa ARES component on the Capital City net.<br>
      <br>
If you ever thought you might be interested in applying Amateur radio
to emergency communications, now is the time to get involved. If you
are one of the many people who enjoy the hobby, remember the
contribution that EMRG members are making for the Ottawa community and
Amateur radio as a hobby. <br>

Communications?<br>
