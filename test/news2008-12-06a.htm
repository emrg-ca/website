An Amateur wrote to me the other day saying that they were not clear on
what exactly EMRG would do in an emergency. Looking through the web
site, listening to us talk about the need for re-organization of EMRG
and the recent posting about terrorism on the email list, left this
person with no clear view in their head. It is questions like this that
help me see where we are, or are not. I have been dealing with this for
so long at an intense level that it all seems very clear to me, but
people can't read my mind, so I thought I should provide a short
summary.
      <br>
      <br>
In an emergency, if our clients require our services (just because
there
is an emergency does not mean they need our services), our typical role
would be to support shelters and community patrols like in the Ice
Storm
and Power Outage. EMRG clients are the organizations who actually use
EMRG emergency communications services. The three main clients are the
City of Ottawa Department of Community Services, the Ottawa Red Cross,
and the Ottawa Salvation Army. These organizations have identified a
possible requirement for radio communications in an emergency and a
desire to have EMRG provide that radio communications service. We are
not a backup solution for the Police, Fire and Paramedics. They have no
plans or requirements for our services and we have no plans, nor the
capability to support them.
      <br>
      <br>
It does not matter what type of emergency or disaster takes place, our
role is to help the humanitarian organizations take care of the
population who are either at home without services or displaced and
living in shelters. The only difference between a storm, fire,
earthquake, terrorist attack, plane crash, building collapse or a giant
accident, is the amount of damage and the difficulty getting around
after due to debris or security.
      <br>
      <br>
Our clients are looking for communications within the City of Ottawa,
to
link their command centres and headquarters with shelters or community
patrols. This is VHF/UHF communications, typically using repeaters.
Long
range HF communications is unlikely to be required and if it is, we
would use a home station as a relay. Home stations are of little value
for emergency communications. We need people to leave home with their
radio and provide communications from one of the client sites, such as
a
shelter. Vehicle radios are only of use if a mobile capability is
required, either while going to your assigned destination, or during a
community patrol.
      <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN DOING
      </span><br>
What I think we have not been doing is practicing and perfecting what
we
do, both within EMRG and with our clients. I did not engage the clients
yet because I believe we should not engage our clients in a more
detailed way unless we have the basics in place to support that
engagement, which is also the foundation on which to build
improvements.
This is the reason we have not been in the "practicing and perfecting"
phase so far.
      <br>
      <br>
The 3 key problems are not having any Training and Exercise
planning/coordination capability, along with delays in getting basic
voice infrastructure in place.While the technical stuff is getting
close
and we can put on a push, use something temporary or otherwise make a
reasonable showing, without an effective Exercise and Training
component, we won't get anywhere sustainable. This is why the
reorganization of EMRG is so important.
      <br>
      <br>
With these 3 things, Training, Exercises and Infrastructure, we can
engage our clients with a reasonable expectation of putting our best
foot forward. We need to demonstrate that we are a serious volunteer
group. We don't need to be perfect, but we need to be organized and
look
like we put a little thought into their requirements.
      <br>
      <br>
1) Infrastructure (voice repeaters to support more than one channel
from
most key locations)
We need to be able to get two channels from the Orleans Sportsplex,
Nepean Sportsplex, Ottawa Red Cross on Catherine St, City EOC at city
Hall, and Community Services Command Centre in Ben Franklin Place
Centrepoint. They may not ask for all these at once, but we could be
asked for any combination of a few of them. The repeaters are almost
all
in place (enough to move forward), but we need to complete the end user
radios for the Red Cross, EOC and at least 1 portable shelter kit.
      <br>
      <br>
2) Training plan
We need the plan and the capability to add and deliver new topics, as
identified from interaction with clients. It may be that we need to
develop some specific training, or the client may be able to provide
some training, but we need to understand where it fits in our plans and
be able to help them shape it if it needs to be shaped to fit our
skills
and time frame. (For example having OFS provide ICS in 2 hours rather
than 2 weeks.)
      <br>
      <br>
3) Exercise Capability.
We need the plan and the capability to develop a joint exercise with
the
client. It is not enough to let the client develop an exercise and we
just jump in where they put us. We need to help them develop a true
test
of our capabilities. We had John Senez (before he had 2 kids) which
worked well. The Airport exercise took a lot of time for both John and
I, but we had a really good role for ERMG, deployed to many locations
and worked with several clients. It should have been the beginning of
things, not the one and only.
      <br>
      <br>
Putting together a simple exercise is not a huge task, but somebody
needs to do it. Somebody needs to put together lessons learned and get
somebody in training to build up the areas in which we are deficient.
Once somebody has done the training, we need somebody to plan another
exercise to build skills and test what we learned. This brings us to
the
big question about whether anyone knows somebody, because somebody
needs
to be involved to make all this happen.
      <br>
      <br>
Back to my original note that we need to move forward three areas,
infrastructure, training and exercises, in parallel. Doing this once is
difficult for the management team alone and doing it a couple times a
year is beyond us. Since we can't get somebody to do all these things,
then we need to break things down and get somebody to take on these
slightly smaller more manageable pieces.
This is the great quagmire that we have been wadding in for some time.
We are not a long way from success, but unfortunately we are just as
close to failure if we don't make changes.
      <br>
      <br>
I hope this helps anyone who was not sure. We are working on
improvements to the content on the web site, but that too takes time
and
I need to multi task between that, the re-organization, technical stuff
and the ongoing administration of the organization. <br>
