      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">INTRODUCTION</span><br>
The saying <b style="">Fail to
plan, plan to fail</b>, applies to Amateur radio emergency
communications.
Planning provides an opportunity to ask questions, look at alternatives
and
seek more information in order to decide on the best option, without
the pressure
of people waiting for an answer. Many of these things are not serious
issues, but there
is more than one option so EMRG selects one, so everyone follows the
same
option. It might be as simple as what simplex frequency to use on VHF.
Everyone
has a favorite and they will all work, but deployment goes much quicker
if
everyone knows in advance which frequency to use and everyone is using
the same
one. During an emergency, time can be wasted trying to make these
decisions,
which could have been made in advance.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>Planning also allows time for a
group of people to work
through the various options, identify pros and cons, and reaching a
consensus on
the best option. The planning process may require discussions with
clients and
partners about requirements, availability of space or equipment and
funding. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">There are many things to consider in
developing effective
communications solutions. To be effective, everyone must be pulling in
the same
direction, at the same time and that direction must be the one that
will provide
the most value for the effort. This is why just bringing a bunch of
people and
equipment together in an emergency does not produce the best results.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      <a name="personalprep"></a><br>
PERSONAL PREPAREDNESS</span><br>
Before you can go help others, you need to take care of yourself and
your family first. You can make this a lot easier by planning in
advance. The <a

of Ottawa</a>, the <a
 href="http://www.emergencymanagementontario.ca/english/prepare/athome/athome.html">Province
of Ontario</a> and the <a

all have excellent information for personal preparedness.<br>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>The City of Ottawa Office of
Emergency Management (OEM)
deals with all aspects of emergency planning. EMRG is providing a small
component of the communications function of the response plan. While
the
service Amateur radio provides is important, it is important for
Amateurs to
understand that we are a very small part of a very large picture. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Being Effective<br>
        </b>Without planning, training and practice, Amateurs are just
volunteers with
a radio. Effective communications is not about individuals creating
ad-hoc
solutions. Emergency communications requires a Team, with <b>pre-planned,
tested &amp; practiced<span style="">&nbsp; </span>solutions</b> <b>that
meet client needs and that clients can depend on</b>. To be effective,<b
 style=""> </b>Amateur radio must be part of the
local integrated emergency response effort, which requires pre-planning
&amp;
commitment. EMRG is not a first, second or third responder. Amateur
radio
provides a communications service to support humanitarian relief
organizations,
so EMRG deploys to support its clients. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">When deploying with a client, Amateurs
need
to co-locate
with the people being supported. (Side by side). Sitting at the back of
the
room, running down the hall or outside, are not effective solutions. It
is also
important for Amateurs to think about portability, so radios need to be
removable from homes and vehicles, to be deployed where needed.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><a name="first24hours"></a><br>
THE FIRST
24 To 48 HOURS IS CRITICAL<o:p></o:p></b><br>
Amateur radio can make its greatest impact in the first 24
to 48 hours of a disaster while information is being gathered,
decisions are being
made, and if there was communications infrastructure damage, repairs
are not
completed yet. Within 24 to 48 hours of a disaster, repairs of existing
communications systems have begun and commercial backup systems will
begin
deployment to replace or increase commercial communications
capabilities. The
point is that Amateurs must be prepared and have developed
relationships in
advance so that clients think about EMRG communications services and
EMRG can
deliver quickly what is required.<br>

AMATEUR RADIO INVOLVEMENT IN AN EMERGENCY<o:p></o:p></b><br>
The pyramid drawing shows several components of emergency
response and the involvement of Amateur radio. It also shows where the
largest
number of the general population are taken care of in an emergency.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>At the top are the highly skilled and
equipped First Responders (Police, Fire, Paramedics), who take care of
a small
number of people in critical situations. At the bottom is the care of
the
general population, those who are not seriously injured, but who cannot
return
to their home. This is the main area for Amateur radio involvement,
supporting
shelters and community patrols.</p>

EMRG PLANNING FOCUS<o:p></o:p></b><br>
Emergencies or Disasters can be broken into 3 simple
categories. The most common category is emergencies that happen every
day, such
as accidents and fires, large and small, that are taken care of by
Police, Fire
and Paramedics as part of their routine service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
most talked about category is the “Big
One”, the disaster that devastates everything. While these can happen,
many
people will never see one and since it is so devastating, any
pre-planning
could be wiped out, depending on what happens. EMRG planning focuses on
the
middle category, which is a large emergency - disaster, which has
happened in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:place></st1:city>
and is likely to
happen again. Some examples are supporting the Red Cross PDA program
which
could be taking care of up to 50 people displaced, the power outage,
the Ice
Storm, a plane crash, or a large building evacuation.</p>

 <!-->The
middle catagory of Emergency – Disaster allows planning for different
scenarios, with different levels of impact, which is why EMRG focuses
on this
area. While there can be devastation of some type, over some area,
there is an
expectation that some solutions have survived and some people are able
to
respond to help others. Requirements can be gathered from clients for
the
different scenarios, solutions can be developed and business cases
written to
support funding for equipment required. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>This does not mean that
EMRG is ignoring the possibility of
a massive disaster in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:place></st1:city>.
What it does mean is that EMRG acknowledges that if a massive disaster
were to
hit <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:city></st1:place>,
there is no way to predict what communications capability would
survive, or how
many EMRG members would be able to respond. The devastation may be so
great
that no one internally can help and we would depend on people and
equipment
from outside the area to assist.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>By focusing on what is
likely to happen, EMRG is able to
prepare and train, as well as provide service as required. If there is
a major devastating
disaster (the big one), EMRG training and preparation would be drawn on
to
build the best solutions possible at the time, based on the equipment
and
people available.</p>

EMRG
SOLUTION
DEVELOPMENT MODEL<o:p></o:p></b><br>
All EMRG solutions are developed based on client
requirements. Just because an ARES group somewhere else has implemented
a new
network, or new equipment, does not mean that EMRG will follow.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The diagram shows the User Requirements on
the left, which are reviewed by EMRG against capabilities and
resources. The
output of this process is an effective solution that meets user
(Client)
requirements. EMRG delivers internal training on the new solution then
tests it
with an EMRG exercise. Further exercises with the clients allow EMRG to
determine what works and what does not which is fed back into the
planning and
analysis process, to fine tune the solution.</p>

EMRG FUNDING<o:p></o:p></b><br>
Most funding for EMRG projects comes from the City of <st1:city
 w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:place></st1:city>. This
funding may
be through direct project funding as part of the City – EMRG agreement,
or the
City may pay directly for services, such as riggers for work on a
tower. All
funding requests are based on a business case which identifies the
client
requirement, the solution and how this solution provides value for the
City of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:place></st1:city>.
The City has
always been supportive of EMRG projects and EMRG takes pride in making
sure
that money is well spent for projects that add value, rather than just
buying
the latest radio.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p><b style=""><a name="strategy"></a><br>
EMRG STRATEGY<o:p></o:p></b><br>
In 2002, work began on the EMRG strategy. The goal was to
define who EMRG worked for, what they needed and how to deliver
solutions to
meet those needs. In 2003, the City of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:place></st1:city>
delivered its’ 5 Year Plan, which outlined the emergency planning
strategy for
the City. EMRG reviewed this document and created its own <b style=""><a
 href="http://www.emrg.ca/EMRG-302_Disaster_Comm_5_Year_Plan.pdf">5
year plan</a></b> <a
 href="http://www.emrg.ca/EMRG-302_Disaster_Comm_5_Year_Plan.pdf"><span
 style=""><span style=""></span></span></a>
to guide EMRG projects.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>In 2004, EMRG completed
the
5 year plan and created a Yearly
Strategy Plan, which defined what would be delivered in year 1 of the 5
year
plan. At the end of 2004, EMRG also signed a new 3 year agreement with
the City
of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:place></st1:city>,
which included funding for the EMRG projects over the 3 years. The <a
 href="http://www.emrg.ca/EMRG-303_Yearly_Strategy_Plan.pdf">Yearly
Strategy
Plan</a>&nbsp;
has been
updated each year to reflect progress and changes over time.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Work on the EMRG 5 year plan officially
began in 2005.
Looking back in 2008, at the end of year 4, it was clear that progress
on the 5
year plan was not as expected. Three major issues have impacted EMRG
progress
on the 5 year plan;</p>
        <ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="1" type="1">
          <li class="MsoNormal" style="">EMRG management assumed there
was a large pool of willing volunteers in the Amateur community in <st1:place
 w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Ottawa</st1:city></st1:place>, waiting
for a sign that someone had a plan, and that once the plan began
implementation, there would be increased numbers of volunteers to
assist in the work. This proved not to be true and the numbers of
volunteers in EMRG did not change. The work done by EMRG has fallen on
the shoulders of a few people wearing many hats.</li>
          <li class="MsoNormal" style="">The plan included technical
projects only, and did not take into account the other operational
tasks such as Training, Exercises and ongoing operation of the group,
which also take time and effort to manage. In the 2006 Yearly Strategy,
some effort was made to broaden the strategy to include these functions
and by the 2008 plan, the strategy reflected the full requirements of
EMRG activity.</li>
          <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Several unexpected events have
taken place over time, impacting the direction of the EMRG plan, such
as the EOC renovation and the Red Cross move to new head quarters.
These are all good things and EMRG has been able to responds, however
in a small organization, adding more work causes other activities to
slide.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b><a name="deployment"></a><br>
DEPLOYMENT CHALLENGES<o:p></o:p></b><br>
In theory, each radio location should have at least 2 people
per shift, one as the radio operator and one as the logger, runner,
relief
operator. Each shift should be 8 hours in length due to the stress of
intense
radio communications, so each radio operator would work slightly more
than 8
hours per day, allowing time for hand off at each end of their shift.
Based on
this model, the minimum number of people per site, per day is 6.
Operating the
EMRG communications centre requires a few more people per shift to
cover net
control operators, operations manager, logistics, planning and if
mutual aid is
required, a liaison person. In an emergency, some EMRG members will not
be
available due to work, family, or the impact of the emergency/disaster
on
themselves and their family. </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>EMRG recognizes that staffing
the
City Emergency Operations
Centre, the EMRG communications centre, the Ottawa Red Cross Head
Quarters,
Community Services Command Centre and a couple shelters, will consume
more
Amateur resources than EMRG can provide, using the model of 6 people
per shift.
There are several strategies to ensure EMRG has sufficient resources;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>EMRG is developing communications solutions that are
user friendly, so one EMRG person on site can provide the technical and
license requirements,
while client
staff can use the voice or data communications solutions directly.</li>
          <li>There will be local Amateurs who do not participate in
EMRG, but who will
volunteer in an emergency. These volunteers would be paired up with an
EMRG
member, effectively doubling the operator capacity available.</li>
          <li>Mutual Aid is recognized by EMRG and neighbouring ARES
groups as a requirement
to support a sustained operation. There is a ARES
mutual aid plan for <st1:place w:st="on">Eastern Ontario</st1:place>,
which includes all ARES groups.</li>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="volunteers"></a><br>
USING VOLUNTEERS IN AN EMERGENCY</span><br>
In an emergency there
will be amateurs who volunteer however an emergency is not the time to
try to introduce people with unknown skills and personalities.&nbsp;
The public expects their local Emergency Planners, the Red
Cross and the Salvation Army to have an effective plan, built on known
resources that can deliver results in an emergency. In order for EMRG
to be
part of their plans, EMRG must provide some level of commitment to
being able
to meet their needs. Saying “Trust us, lots of unknown people will come
out in
an emergency” is not a trusted resource that can deliver results.
Shelters are
full of people who have been traumatized by whatever happened. This is
not the
place to send people who are not clear on their responsibilities, not
clear on
who is in charge and who are not cleared through any personal clearance
procedures to ensure they are not a threat to people in the shelter.
The same
is true for secure sites such as the City Emergency Operations Centre
and the
EMRG communications centre, which are not the place to send new faces
that may
not know their place.<br>
