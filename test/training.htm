EMRG training has taken place, but is has been adhoc over the years, as
EMRG struggled to get someone who could
take on the task of creating a plan and organizing the delivery of
training. The EMRG re-organization of how functions like
training are delivered will resolve this issue and training
will move forward in a consistent and organized manner.<br>
      <br>
There are many examples online for ARES training, but much of it is
tailored to the requirements for a specific area, and these requirments
do not apply in Ottawa. EMRGs objective is to make sure training is
relevant to the area, EMRG operations, and of use to EMRG members. The
focus is on what EMRG members need to know in order to be useful in
Ottawa and as part of Mutual Aid.<br>
