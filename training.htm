      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>EMRG training has taken place, but is has been adhoc over the years, as EMRG struggled to get someone who could take on the task of creating a plan and organizing the delivery of training. The EMRG re-organization of how functions like training are delivered will resolve this issue and training will move forward in a consistent and organized manner.
      </p>

      <p>There are many examples online for ARES training, but much of it is tailored to the requirements for a specific area, and these requirments do not apply in Ottawa. EMRGs objective is to make sure training is relevant to the area, EMRG operations, and of use to EMRG members. The focus is on what EMRG members need to know in order to be useful in Ottawa and as part of Mutual Aid.
