      <p> Welcome to the EMRG Training Page. The purpose of this page
is to provide EMRG members with a single location to access training
documents, links and references that focus on EMRG delivery of
Emergency and Disaster communications. </p>
      <p>One of the primary strategy objectives for EMRG is to maintain
stability and consistency in the organization. Training is an important
part of ensuring EMRG has the skills to deliver on client requirements,
which is why EMRG has adopted a training program that focuses on the
basics.</p>
      <p>For more information please read the EMRG Training Plan: <a
 href="EMRG-401_Training_Plan.pdf">EMRG-401 Training Plan</a>.<br>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="TrainingObjectives"></a>TRAINING
OBJECTIVES</span><br>
The main objective of EMRG training is to ensure that EMRG members have
the basic skills required to effectively deliver EMRG communications
services in an emergency. To be effective requires an understanding of
the following areas;<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>EMRG organization, roles and responsibilities, clients and
partners</li>
        <li>How to activate the group in an emergency and deploy to an
assigned location with the skills to establish an effective
communications solution.</li>
        <li>Once on the air, have the basic skills to take messages
from people in their location and send those messages to the
destination. This includes the ability to receive incoming messages and
to log key activity at their station.</li>
        <li>Once EMRG is no longer required, successfully deactivate as
directed and participate in the de-brief through personal notes and
group sessions.</li>
        <li>For locations with permanent equipment, understand how to
access the site, rules of behavior in the site and how to operate the
equipment onsite.</li>
        <li>Understand proper respect and handling for information that
may be heard on site that is not public.</li>
        <li>Be capable of working with our Mutual aid partners in
neighbouring ARES groups.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
      </p>
 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Other
objectives of EMRG training include </span><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Training as a group helps evolve from being a group of
people, to being a team.</li>
        <li>Increase and maintain a level of technical expertise of
EMRG members</li>
        <li>Increase members activity and retention.</li>
        <li>Attract new members</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="FoundationRequirements"></a>FOUNDATION REQUIREMENTS</span><br>
The training and documentation that represents the minimum that must be
understood by EMRG members is set out in the Foundation Requirements
below.<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="EMRG-402_The_Four_Cs_of_Communications.pdf">EMRG-402: The Four Cs of Communications</a></li>

        <li><a href="EMRG-408_Pesonal_Preparedness.pdf">EMRG-408: Personal Preparedness</a></li>
        <li><a href="EMRG-103_Notification_Plan.pdf">EMRG-103: Notification Plan</a></li>

        <li><a href="EMRG-111_Deactivation_Plan.pdf">EMRG-111: De-Activation Plan</a></li>
        <li><a href="EMRG-112_De-Brief_Plan.pdf">EMRG-112: De-Brief Plan</a> (To be completed)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
Over time, the Foundation Requirements can grow as new documents and
courses are developed and designated as Foundation Requirements. All of
these are subject to updating as circumstances require.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Supporting Documents &amp;
Training</span><br>
There are other documents and courses that cover topics of interest
that are not part of the foundation requirements. Over time, new
supporting documents and training will be developed and posted on the
EMRG website. <br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Examples of supporting training topics are Basic Net
Control, Cross Band Repeaters and Introduction To CTCSS. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Examples of supporting documents includes EMRG-207
Frequency List and EMRG-516 Repeater Guide. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="SkillsEvaluation"></a>SKILLS EVALUATION</span><br>

<p>Each training course will include a quiz at the end to confirm that the
individual has understood the basic concepts presented. The answers will be
provided on a subsequent page so the user can test their level of
understanding. In some cases, such as essay type questions, the answers will be
a discussion of relevant points, rather than a specific answer.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is the responsibility of each EMRG member to complete
the course, take the quiz and review the areas that were weak.</li>
        <li>Tracking of training completed and when, is also the
responsibility of the individual EMRG member. <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="PersonalEvaluationRecord"></a>PERSONAL TRAINING RECORD</span><br>
The form for EMRG members to record and track their training is <a
 href="EMRG-519_Personal_Training_Record.pdf">EMRG-519: Personal Training Record</a>. Since most of the EMRG training is done
individually off the web, it is necessary for each member to track
their own training. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Personal Training Record provides a convenient method to
track which courses are completed and when they were completed. If it
has been a few years since a particular session was completed, or if an
update has been released, please repeat the session and mark it
again. Ideally, everyone should review each on line FOUNDATION
session each year. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The training record can be used to track other training
completed, whether in or outside of EMRG, such as the RAC CEC course,
Canwarn, First Aid or other.<br>
