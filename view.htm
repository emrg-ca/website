<p><a NAME="INTRODUCTION"></a><b><u><font size=+1>1.0 INTRODUCTION</font></u></b>
<br>The concept of Amateur radio as an Emergency Communications resource
has developed over a long period of time, based on a mix of National, Regional
and local requirements, viewed from a Governmental and Amateur radio perspective.
This web page is intended to document information, concepts and ideas based
on the belief that there is a growing&nbsp; gap between what is required
or expected for emergency communications and what Amateur radio is providing.
<p>Amateur radio struggles for acceptance as an emergency communications
resource, because expectations are not aligned with requirements. We fight
to be integrated into and respected by the First Response organizations,
but they resist, not because they don't care, not because they don't like
us, they resist because they do not see a role for us. This error in direction
is fully endorsed by many levels of Government, Amateur "experts", the
ARRL and RAC, through their statements or lack of clarification. Many amateurs
are bitter and many locations are left without effective volunteer communications
solutions because we struggle to get to where we are not required, into
the First Response area.
<p><a NAME="Opportunities"></a><b>1.1 Opportunities</b>
<br>There are many opportunities for Amateur radio to be a critical resource,
a sought after resource, a respected resource, in many emergencies even
if telecommunications has not failed or is not overloaded. We need to focus
on developing the role where there is a match between what we provide and
who we work with. The tasks and organizations involved in establishment
of shelters, checking on people in their homes, citizen patrols etc., provides
a great fit with who we are and what we can provide. This would include
Red Cross, People Services (Social Services), Health, Salvation Army etc.
I see this as the greatest opportunity because these organizations typically
lack telecom skills, don't have a radio system and need to communicate
with diverse locations. We have the opportunity to be their telecom experts,
both under normal and failure conditions.
<p>Over time we will prove ourselves as committed, dependable and useful.
This will open doors for other opportunities in which we may be able to
provide more specialty applications for first response support. We are
just volunteers, no better than anyone who volunteers for the Salvation
Army, Red Cross or Saint John Ambulance. We must EARN respect!
<p><a NAME="Missing Opportunities"></a><b>1.2 Missing Opportunities Today</b>
<br>We are failing to meet the needs of organizations we claim to support
today, because we do not have the relationship or technical solutions in
place. The National Red Cross - ARES agreement is an important statement
of cooperation between the two groups, but neither group has any resources
at a National level to do anything more than sign paper. Implementation
of the agreement must be done at a local level, but neither organization
(Red Cross, ARES) has moved to effectively implement the relationship locally.
<p>In an impromptu survey of ARES groups in Ontario, most groups do not
have a working relationship with their local Red Cross group. Some have
agreements, but most Red Cross groups will not allow ARES groups to handle
the primary pieces of data, Registration and Inquiry. We had an agreement
in Ottawa with the Red Cross, only to find out later that they associated
ARES with HF, Province wide or National communications. They would not
have thought to call us to communicate across the City. That has now changed,
but it takes time, work and dedication, it's not easy.
<p>In most discussions about radio operation, people describe the importance
of having two people, one operator and one logger at each location. But
how many groups act on this to ensure they have the technical capability
to do this? Simple headphone amplifiers will allow each person to adjust
the volume to their level, which is important for hours of listening. Microphone
mixers allow more than one microphone, so the two people can both operate
the
radio without the need to sit side by side and pass the mic back and forth.
Why is it that people spend great effort building equipment for disaster
site deployment, but spend little or no time preparing to operate from
a shelter?
<p><a NAME="Living On"></a><b>1.3 Living On Legend</b>
<br>We are living on our legend to some extent and if we do not change,
we will be of less assistance over time, making amateur radio eventually
a solution of last resort. Agencies will be forced to develop alternative
strategies to ensure they have a suitable backup solution if normal communications
fails. This page is critical about some aspects of amateur radio emergency
communications, but that is not meant to imply that amateur radio is a
failure or that amateur radio cannot be a vibrant successful solution.
We are where we are as a result of Amateur and Government action and inaction
on these topics. However as amateurs we can show leadership in defining
the areas that need to change and helping drive that change.
<p>Not all amateurs share my views, Many believe that Amateur radio is
a vibrant, functional emergency communications resource as implemented
today, so they feel this discussion is not required. Some hams believe
that;
<li>
In an emergency, Amateurs will respond as "spontaneous volunteers" so no
advanced organization is required</li>

<li>
Holding an amateur radio operator license makes an individual a trained
communicator</li>

<li>
If you bring a group of Amateur radio operators together in an emergency,
you have an effective communications team</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="One Size Does Not Fit"></a><b>1.4 One Size Does Not Fit All</b>
<br>There are many variations across Canada, based on the Province we live
in and the size of our local community in terms of population and land
area. Each area will have slightly different views and requirements which
open or close some doors. However there are many areas that are common
across Canada. It is the commonalties we need to organize first and build
local variations on top of the common structure. This will allow for the
greatest sharing of information and ideas and provides an interface for
utilizing volunteers from outside our area in an emergency.
<p><a NAME="Oscillation"></a><b>1.5 Group Oscillation</b>
<br>For years, the volunteer amateur radio group in Ottawa was known for
its starts and stops. Someone would put on a push to get things moving
and when they stopped pushing, everything stopped moving. Then the same
person, or someone else would come along and the cycle (oscillation) continued.
<p>The same problem appears to exist across North America, at least to
some level. Watching email lists for several years in the US and Canada,
there are constant notes from someone saying. "I am looking for advice,
we just formed an ARES group in our area after years of having nothing",
Our EC just quit, moved, got tired, etc. and I am trying to keep our group
going, any suggestions".
<p>It appears that most groups exist due to the efforts of a few (1 or
2 in many cases) who put in the time to build relationships and make contacts.
Local amateurs "sign up" and wait for direction. People will come out for
meetings and training and exercises, but most amateurs are waiting for
"them" to organize it. The few people doing the work become frustrated,
develop additional family commitments or have work related changes, which
cause them to step down or reduce their effort. Once this happens, the
groups seem to go into a dormant state, where all activity stops, or they
meet, but there is no one doing the organization, so nothing effectively
happens.
<p>The Group Oscillation interacts with the Misconceptions of our role,
so the few people organizing things are caught fighting needless battles
trying to get the attention of First Response leaders or in other cases,
they have little help in developing solutions for required deployment such
as shelters or other buildings.
<p>This is a complicated problem, but it gets back to defining our role
and having amateurs and Gov. UNDERSTAND and support the role. From there,
we can direct our energy towards positive development. There are other
things we need to work on as well, including leadership, so we can delegate
more and bring more interaction within the group. Many people wait to be
told what to do, but once you get them on side, they will take the project
and see it to completion.
<p><a NAME="Understanding Our Role"></a><b>1.6 Understanding Our Role</b>
<br>In thinking about "What Is Our Role",&nbsp; we are trying to look at
something that is never discussed, leaving it open to interpretation and
assumption, which is why we are here discussing it now. The Federal Government,
through the Emergency Preparedness Collage in Arnprior promotes amateur
radio as a "Valuable" resource and does a bit of demonstration using
<br>Amateur radio as part of the training exercise. Provincial emergency
measures staff also promote amateur radio as a valuable resource. So now
the Municipal Emergency Planners know that Amateur radio is a great resource
to have.
<p>The Municipal planner and the local Amateur group sign an agreement
and the Amateur radio resource is in place. Everyone now waits for something
to happen. The Emergency planner is assuming that the Amateurs know what
to do and are prepared, while the amateurs are assuming the Emergency planner
will be telling them what to do. In the absence of discussion between the
Emergency Planner and Amateur radio operators, amateurs develop their own
perspective, which includes when and how they feel they should be used.
Expectations are not aligned, so they will not be met and another emergency
planner is labeled as incompetent and uncaring.
<p>Based on discussions I have had with Federal, Provincial and Municipal
emergency planners, I feel none of them could describe the role of amateur
radio in an emergency (This means more than just "Provide Backup Communications").
It has become a check list item, along with bottled water, the Red Cross,
blankets and batteries. This is not because they don't care, but Amateur
radio is not one of their biggest issues and we have done a great job promoting
how ready we are, so they assume everything is OK.
<p>I also don't expect any level of Government to take the bull by the
horns and drive this, so it is up to Amateur radio to define our role and
then work to educate various levels of government. In this process they
will provide feedback, which can be taken in to help define our role and
to ensure we have agreement and understanding from everyone, Amateur and
Government, as to what our role is in an emergency. This will ensure that
expectations are aligned between groups, which means success and happiness.
<p><a NAME="The Need To Be Transparent"></a><b>1.7 The Need To Be Transparent</b>
<br>The organizations that Amateur radio supports in an emergency, use
phone, fax, email and cell phones as their daily tools and they plan to
use those same tools in an emergency. If phone lines fail and Amateur radio
replaces the normal communications tools, there is a mismatch between what
we typically provide and what users will expect. People expect to talk
directly with people, not through a message form. Email and fax do not
work on voice radio systems.
<p>There are two issues;
<li>
How to have the end user more involved in the message transfer process,
because they expect to have that ability and because there may not be sufficient
numbers of amateurs to operate all positions.</li>

<li>
How to present the same interfaces that the users normally see, but transfer
the information using amateur radio. In other words, the users should not
know the difference between operation with phone lines and operation without.
This is where amateur radio becomes transparent to the users.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>The three standard user interfaces for information exchange are the
telephone, the FAX machine and the PC with email software. The challenge
for Amateur radio, is to develop the interfaces to allow this. The background
radio infrastructure does not need to change much. Conventional crystal
radios can still be used, the enhancement is the user interface.
<p>We are technical people and the solutions are not complex or costly.
What it does take is the will and effort to develop these solutions. Here
are some <a href="http://www.emrg.ca/projectideas.htm">example projects</a>
related to this topic.

<p><a NAME="Aligning Expectations"></a><b>2.3 Aligning Expectations With
Requirements</b>
<br>There are several internet email lists related to Amateur emergency
communications. There are stories of amateurs arrested by police, of being
escorted from the emergency site, of not being allowed to set up their
radio because it might interfere with the police or fire, the list is endless.
These stories point out that emergency organizations don't understand,
don't care, are incompetent, etc.
<p>Most of the Amateur radio effort goes into preparing for direct support
of First Responders, to be able to link them together when their complicated,
poorly built, over utilized systems fail, even though they do not respond
enthusiastically to the idea. This includes things like the need for coloured
vests for visibility in a disaster area and the need for ID recognized
by police and other first responders. Many amateurs are intent on creating
some form of communications trucks or trailers for radio operations from
the disaster area, just in case. This is not to be confused with locations
where volunteers and officials have a relationship and part of that relationship
is the need for an amateur communications capability that is mobile.
<p>Direct support of First Response agencies is an area that has the least
opportunities for Amateurs over time, that requires the highest level of
inter-agency skills and has the least success rate, because it requires
a very very solid relationship with demonstrated commitment and skill.

<br>Emergency Management exists at all levels of Government;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>City</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Emergency Measures Unit (EMU)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Province</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emergency

(OCIPEP)
<p>Responsible to facilitate problem solving and resource acquisition for
emergency response. They bring the resources available at their level of
government to solve problems related to the emergency or disaster. In Canada,
Emergency Management has minimal field resources, who work as co-ordinators,
not response workers or commanders.
<p>In periods when there are no emergencies, they are responsible to manage
planning and preparation, which includes maintaining resource contacts,
preparing and reviewing emergency plans and initiating exercises to test
plans.
<p><a NAME="Amateur Radio Interface"></a><b>3.2 Amateur Radio Interface</b>
<br>Amateur radio interfaces to the local municipality, as one of the resources
under Emergency Management. This should be the primary relationship between
the Amateur radio group and the local Municipality. Ideally this includes
Amateur radio being written into the Municipally emergency plan. Signed
agreements and being written into the emergency plan is important, but
the most important aspect is the relationship between the Amateur group
and the members of the Emergency Management office. If the relationship
does not exist, then being written into the plan will not ensure that Amateur
radio is activated or that it is activated in a timely manner. People use
what they know!!! Get to know your emergency planning office.
<p><a NAME="Making Decisions"></a><b>3.3 Making Decisions</b>
<br>The following comments are from the Ontario ARES discussion and are
copied here, because they make a great statement that I agree with.
<blockquote>"we need to understand that in an emergency, the civil power
authority does not always have exactly the right resource for any given
emergency situation. He must, as a function of his authority, apply risk
analysis to each situation, in particular the use of a resource for which
it was not intended. He will allocate a resource to best support the existing
emergency. The use of non licensed personnel (trained or otherwise) to
provide emergency communications is an obvious answer when licensed personnel,
for whatever reason, are unavailable at the time. We don't have a choice
in this matter unless we do not participate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>""When necessary, any rule that impedes the progress of the
emergency team but does not compromise the safety of the team, may be disregarded
for that specific emergency."&nbsp; This is not an all encompassing rational
for an overall emergency, but rather for specific instances within emergencies
in which the civil authority has utilized data to support the solution
to a problem based on the risk analysis of the impact of the solution."</blockquote>
<a NAME="Emergency Vs Disaster"></a><b>3.4 Emergency Vs Disaster - Big
Vs Small</b>
<br>There are official definitions for Emergency Vs Disaster, but the two
can and are often used interchangeably. The classic disaster response scenario
that many Amateurs prepare for, is a disaster that impacts a lot of people,
covers a large area and disrupts telecommunications within the area and
into and out of the area. This scenario includes a declaration of a state
of emergency and resources from outside the area coming in to help.
<p>There are many Emergencies which impact smaller groups of people, cover
smaller areas, are not declared as a state of emergency, but provide opportunities
for amateur radio to provide assistance. For example (this is a real example)
a large apartment building is struck by lightning and must be evacuated
until the building can be inspected. Local communications may be out and
shelters need to be established for the people to go to.
<p>Another scenario is a Red Cross program (does not exist everywhere)
called PPDA (P.. Personal Disaster Assistance). This program works with
Fire and Police, to provide shelter for people who have been forced out
of their home, typically because of fire. Many people have friends and
family in the area, or the money to go to a hotel, but many do not. This
Red Cross program will support in theory up to 50 people being displaced
at one time. Normally there is only a couple families at most and cell
phones work fine, but imagine trying to coordinate this for even 30 people
using cell phones. Plus there is an issue with getting enough cell phones.
<p>Waiting only for a declared state of emergency, may mean a long wait
to ever be called, or lost time in a real disaster waiting for paper work
to be completed.
<p><a NAME="First 24 to 48 Hours"></a><b>3.5 First 24 to 48 Hours Critical</b>
<br>Amateur radio can make its greatest impact in the first 24 to 48 hours
of a disaster, as part of the chaos reduction, when information is first
being gathered and decisions are being made in order to react to the disaster.
The only systems available, are the ones the exist and are working.
<p>Within 24 to 48 hours of a disaster, commercial backup systems will
be deployed to replace or increase communications capabilities. Commercial
radio providers will expand their systems and add temporary systems, but
it will take 24 to 48 hours to identify the requirement, make arrangements
and have equipment shipped into the area. For example, Ericsson Canada
offered the use of their “Cell on Wheels” (COW) to the US on Sept 11. The
last time the COW was used for disaster communications support was at the
site of the Swiss Air crash in Peggy’s Cove in 1999.
<p>Amateur radio will still be required after 24 to 48 hours, and will
be very useful supporting the humanitarian effort. It is in the first 24
to 48 hours where we have the opportunity to go beyond, to push our capabilities
to the limit and to earn respect for a job well done in tough times.

<br><a NAME="RAC & ARRL"></a><b><u><font size=+1>4.0 RAC &amp; ARRL</font></u></b>
<br>It is important to understand that RAC is a few volunteers who work
hard and rely on members of the Amateur community to provide input as "experts"
on specific topics. Get the wrong expert and you get the wrong answer,
but it is tough to sort the good from the bad, who claim to be good.
<p><a NAME="ARES Only"></a><b>4.1 ARES Only</b>
<br>While ARES is the RAC/ARRL emergency communications program, I feel
there is a significant loss by the failure to recognize and support all
amateurs involved in emergency communications. For example there are many
Red Cross groups who have their own communications group, which is primarily
or entirely amateurs, but RAC does not recognize them in any documentation
on emergency communications. There are also very good amateur emergency
communications groups who are not part of ARES, but who represent amateur
radio well.
<p><a NAME="Attitude"></a><b>4.2 Attitude</b>
<br>Throughout ARRL and RAC documentation on ARES, there are aspects that
I find misleading or offensive towards other agencies and the role of amateur
radio in an emergency. One prime example is the RAC open letter to ECs.
<a href="http://www.rac.ca/open.htm">http://www.rac.ca/open.htm</a>.
The first two paragraphs are fine, but the third paragraph states;
<blockquote>"We have also been asked to emphasize the importance of securing
the formal approval of your municipal council early in your relationship
with the municipality. This should be in the form of a resolution by the
municipal or county/district council appointing you as their Emergency
Telecommunications Coordinator. The title may vary across the country,
but your objective is the same. You must have that endorsement or you cannot
hope to do an effective job for the municipality or community."</blockquote>
The first sentence is true, but the second sentence implies a task which
the local municipality may wish to have you do, but it is not part of the
role of Amateur radio. We are a voluntary resource, we are not part of
the Municipal emergency management team. I feel this was input by someone
who wanted to secure a title, so they can look important, but failed to
see the real role of amateur radio.
<p>There are several different references to emergency officials and the
ease with which they are overwhelmed or intimidated by amateur radio. There
is one about the amateur running up with multiple radios strapped on, all
blaring away. In the RAC Open Letter, there is the following statement;
<blockquote>"Before you even get to the previous stage, you may have to
work your charm on your municipal contact – the Emergency&nbsp; Planner,
who may be Chief Administrative Officer, the Fire or Police Chief. Some
municipal administrators&nbsp; may feel threatened by an outside "manager"
– the ARES Emergency Coordinator. The RAC EC Manual does emphasize the
critical need for the EC to recognize that concern."</blockquote>
The person responsible for emergency planning should not have great difficulty
with amateur radio, if you are promoting communications for shelters, the
Red Cross, local citizen patrols etc. They will be frightened, not intimidated
when it is implied about the need for IDs so amateurs can get to the disaster
core area, etc.
<p><a NAME="ARRL - Starting To Change"></a><b>4.3 ARRL - Starting To Change</b>
<br>The ARRL has started the critical change in attitudes, in it's publication
<a href="http://www.arrl.org/catalog/?item=8462">Amateur
Radio Emergency Communications Course Level I</a>. This book is very open
in its statements about working with other Amateur radio groups, working
with agencies and the need for training. The Level I Book is an excellent
resource for all amateurs in the US &amp; Canada. The other two books in
the set; Level II &amp; Level III do not yet address some of the changes
required in HOW we operate, such as the limitations of the standard message
form.

<br><a NAME="CHALLENGES & HURDLES"></a><b><u><font size=+1>5.0 CHALLENGES
&amp; HURDLES</font></u></b>
<br><a NAME="Fragmentation"></a><b>5.1 Fragmentation</b>
<br>The Amateur radio community is a resource pool, claimed by multiple
groups as part of its resource base. There are a finite number of amateurs
who are willing and able to respond in an emergency. Fragmentation by creating
multiple overlapping, sometimes competing groups, creates an illusion of
a large organization, which in reality is much smaller because each organization
requires a management structure and many amateurs belong to multiple groups.
<p>For example an Amateur radio club may views its membership as an "available
resource" for emergency communications. In reality, there are many in the
club who are not interested or are unable to participate due to personal
health or family responsibilities. Other members of the club may be first
responders who will be applied in that role in an emergency. Still other
members are part of other organizations such as the Red Cross, who would
deploy with those groups in an emergency.&nbsp; The actual number of amateurs
who are available to deploy, is much smaller than the size of the club.
Now that group may be further reduced by members who are also part of more
than one Amateur Emergency specialty group, such as SATERN, Red Cross Communications,
or local groups.
<p>The groups and organizations that use Amateur radio do not understand
these subtle differences. They assume that the Amateur community is one
group, that will respond to provide the best service possible to help in
an emergency. They also assume that there are no politics which will pit
groups against each other, or negatively influence decisions made by Amateurs.
<p><a NAME="What's In A"></a><b>5.2 What's In A Name</b>
<br>There is a lot of discussion about the down side of being called Amateurs.
Many attribute the lack of interest in us as stemming from the word Amateur
in our group names. Some groups use other names to avoid the word Amateur.
Most external agencies or organizations attribute a high degree of regard
for Amateur (Ham) Radio. In some cases, they may actually give us more
credit than we are due. If we are a well organized group, providing solutions
to real problems, the name is not a problem. In fact many of the groups
will not even remember the group name.
<p>For example, in Ottawa, we are well respected by the hospitals, but
many of the emergency planners will not remember our group name. They know
us as the volunteer radio group, which is made up of Amateur radio operators.&nbsp;
I feel the discussion of the word Amateur is an excuse to explain why we
are failing to get in with the First Responders, which I mentioned earlier,
is not where we fit in.
<p><a NAME="Message Handling"></a><b>5.3 Message Handling</b>
<br>The Federal Government, through the Emergency Preparedness Collage,
promotes the use of formal message forms for emergency operations. Amateur
radio through RAC/ARRL also promotes formal messages, through the use of
the Radiogram format. However a recent survey of ARES groups in Ontario
indicates that none of the municipalities they serve have a formal message
form.
<p>Formal messages are not a part of normal operations for Police, Fire,
EMS, Public Works, Social Services, Transportation, etc. Adding them for
emergency use only adds chaos. The use of UTC vs local time adds more confusion.
In the military, people are trained as part of their job and the use of
UTC is not an issue (I hope). However for volunteers or people who do not
use it every day, it can add more error by demanding its use, rather than
relying on local time.
<p>Here are some comments or quotes taken from different sources, some
amateur radio and some not.&nbsp; They are meant to get us thinking and
point out that we are not alone in this.
<p><u>From Firescope - Incident Command System Resource</u>
<br>http://firescope.oes.ca.gov
<br>Under Documents, there are forms for almost everything, but NO message
form.
<p><u>From Doug Monk&nbsp;&nbsp; Picton, Ontario</u>
<br>"Really all we have to do is get the message to a station where the
phones are still working.&nbsp; We don't have to get a message addressed
to Denver to a ham in Denver to deliver."
<p><u>From ARES - Red Cross exercise (SET 2002)</u>
<br>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ARESONTARIO
<br>- CRC and some ARES personnel are unaware of message writing and procedures
<br>- Means of traffic handling could include the use of PSK and other
digital modes
<br>- RAC authorities need to review the formats used for message/data
handling, including handling processes and procedures
<p><u>From "Disaster Communications"; Disaster Relief Communications Foundation</u>
<br>http://www.reliefweb.int/library/dc1/dcc3.html#3.4.2
<br>"A further problem is that amateur networks are designed to relay written
messages from net to net until they arrive at their destination. It takes
quite some minutes for even a simple message to be spoken over the air,
written down, checked, and spoken again to the next net controller etc.
until the message arrives at the addressee. If this requires, for example,
four repetitions of the message, then it can take 20-30 minutes to ask
a question and get a reply. Again, packet operation improves this situation.
"
<p><u>From the BC Telephone Pioneer Web Site</u>
<br>http://www3.telus.net/mike_sankey/index.htm
<br>"In 1989, then club President Farrel (Hoppy) Hopwood had a vision of
being able to send text messages from our capital city, Victoria on Vancouver
Island to the interior city of Kamloops during a state of emergency.&nbsp;
Hoppy felt that the use of voice messaging was too slow and at times inaccurate.&nbsp;
He felt that if a message could be typed and sent out as packet file to
the
<br>receiving station at high speed and printed as a hard copy the number
of messages sent could increase by six times."
<p><a NAME="Military"></a><b>5.4 Civilian Vs Military Model</b>
<br>I am personally not an advocate of using military style communications
as a model for amateur emergency communications. This view is partly because
of a few bad examples of ex military trying to re-create their military
glory in a volunteer group and the fact that the military operates the
way it does because its purpose demands it and it has people dedicated
and trained for tasks. We are a civilian volunteer organization, so I believe
we should model ourselves on the best we can find in that area. Our standards
should be higher than the organizations we serve, with the lowest acceptable
level of organization and discipline being equal to the organizations we
serve. We must be well organized, trained and dedicated, but we will make
mistakes, we will forget, because this is our volunteer activity, not our
job.
<p>The military operates on Command &amp; Control, peoples lives are at
stake, so orders must be followed because they are part of a larger picture.
Civilian agencies operate on the Incident Management System (IMS), originally
called Incident Command System (ICS). This is a team work approach and
feedback from the field is a critical component. The fire fighter can advise
against going into the building, because the fire is more advanced at that
point than command understood at the time.
<p><a NAME="Amateur Attitude"></a><b>5.5 Amateur Attitude</b>
<br>Some hams believe that;
<li>
In an emergency, Amateurs will respond as "spontaneous volunteers" so no
advanced organization is required</li>

<li>
Holding an amateur radio operator license makes an individual a trained
communicator</li>

<li>
If you bring a group of Amateur radio operators together in an emergency,
you have an effective communications team</li>

<br><b>Problem Solved!</b>
<p>There appears to be a large group of amateurs who have become "armchair
experts", placing the normal abilities of amateur radio operators up with
those of specialty units within First Response organizations. By minimizing
the challenges and exaggerating the skill levels, these people have been
able to convince themselves that doing nothing is the only choice, not
an excuse.
<p>Here are some&nbsp; <a href="http://www.emrg.ca/amateurmyths.htm">"Amateur
Myths"</a> about volunteer emergency communications, some presented in
various parts of this note.
<p><a NAME="Getting Enough"></a><b>5.6 Getting Enough People</b>
<br>The traditional model for Amateur radio operation in an emergency,
requires 2 people per location, one operator and one logger/backup operator.
If people work 9 hour shifts, 8 hours with 1 hour overlap, with 2 amateurs
per location x 3 shifts of 9 hours per day = 6 amateurs per day per location.
Doing some math for a simple evacuation:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EOC + Red Cross + NCS + 2 shelters = <u>30 amateurs
per day</u>
<p>In a large scale response, there will be hundreds of amateurs required,
which will also require a great deal of coordination. Tracking people who
volunteer, where they are assigned and when and what to do with them when
they are not working (Volunteers from out of town who don't go home at
night, where do they eat, where do they sleep).
<p>The alternative to requiring large numbers of hams, which raises the
question of availability, is to prepare for the use of non amateurs in
an emergency. This has implications regarding regulations and equipment.
However if we evolve to being a communications provider, not a provider
and message handler, then one amateur can maintain a system and meet the
regulations, if agency non amateurs can send their own messages.
<p><a NAME="Buildings & Terrain"></a><b>5.7 Buildings &amp; Terrain</b>
<br><u>Sealed Buildings&nbsp; - Concrete, Glass &amp; Steel Boxes</u>
<br>Radio communications is often difficult from inside with hand held
radios or cell phones (especially from centre of the building). There are
few entrances (difficult to step outside to use the radio) and no way to
run cables outside to an antenna.&nbsp; Hospitals are most challenging
due to limits on radio power inside the building.
<p>There are two solutions which are usually proposed; Install a permanent
antenna or install a temporary antenna when required and run the coax out
a door or window. It is not always possible to identify all possible buildings
and in many buildings the cost of installing a permanent antenna is quite
high due to the cost of running (typically must be professionally installed)
coax (must be fire rated or in a conduit) through multiple floors. There
is also a problem with the volume of potential sites, where if they all
had a permanent antenna, the cost would be high and there would need to
be a work crew who did nothing but test antennas.
<p>Running coax outside is not always possible due to the location of doors,
type of ceiling, security, severe weather, etc. There are cost effective
solutions that can be built, so they could be applied to any building,
such as wireless remotes, cross band repeaters and telephone line remote
consoles. These are solutions that can be transported to other areas to
offer assistance if required.
<p><u>Distance &amp; Terrain</u>
<br>Communities which are below or behind a major hill, making communications
within the area and from the area back to the core of the City difficult.
In Ottawa, West Carleton is an extreme example, with Fitzroy Harbour, Constance
Bay and Carp all on different sides of hills, plus significant distance
back to central Ottawa.

<br><a NAME="IDEAS & SUGGESTIONS"></a><b><u><font size=+1>6.0 IDEAS &amp;
SUGGESTIONS</font></u></b>
<br><a NAME="Tactical Message"></a><b>6.1 Tactical Message Form</b>
<br>One solution for short tactical messages is to use a phone message
book. The type shown below is in a spiral book with 4 per page and each
one has a duplicate. These are made by a company called Blueline and are
available at stationary stores. There are several choices, depending on
the number of messages per book and some have serialized numbers in them,
but they cost more. Unlike many of the phone message pads, these have room
to write a short message and they come with a duplicate so you get an instant
log.
<p>I thought about these after we did an exercise, where we had messages
coming into the EOC, that had to be passed on to someone else in the EOC.
The radio operator was trying to rip up sheets of paper into strips, because
the messages were short and it just seemed wasteful to use a full sheet
of paper. I started looking around for something that was cheap and would
provide a consistent size and format. When we were doing the messages freehand,
sometimes the TO field was first, but other people tended to put it second.
<p>You can number them sequentially if you want, or just use the time/date/author
to track them. If it is a message that requires a response, just tick the
CALL BACK box and when the response is sent, just tick the RETURNED CALL
box. You can look back through the carbon copy pages, to make sure there
are not outstanding messages waiting for a response. These are also cheap,
so it is easy to have a supply or get people to buy a small one for their
personal kit. I think it makes a cheap and easy solution!

<p><a NAME="Possible Technical Solutions"></a><b>6.2 Possible Technical
Solutions</b>
<br>Amateur radio must become more flexible and transparent as an emergency
communications resource. There are many practical improvements that can
be made using existing radio technology, but with an enhanced interface
to the radio. These enhancements may be simple projects which allow multiple
users on one radio or Packet networks that interface to internal networks
for message routing. Some additional&nbsp; ideas are contained here <a href="projectideas.htm">Link
