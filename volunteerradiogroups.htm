<h1>Volunteer Radio Groups</h1>

<p>
	The main role of a volunteer radio group in an emergency is to establish a secondary
	communications infrastructure to;
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Provide communications for agencies, field workers or local citizen
		patrols, who do not have any radio communication capability
	</li>

	<li>
		Link agencies, which operate on different networks such as People
		Services, Hospitals and the Red Cross
	</li>

	<li>
		Link sites, which do not normally require communications, such as
		evacuation centres.
	</li>

	<li>
		Communicate with areas that have lost normal communications networks
		such as communities isolated by loss of telephone service.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	In the event that primary communications systems used by Police, Fire and
	Ambulance are degraded or disabled by the emergency or disaster, the
	communications infrastructure provided by volunteer radio group can be tailored
	to assist, depending on the specific requirements of the emergency. It is
	important to understand that the volunteer radio group does not provide full
	backup of the primary communications systems. There would only be enough
	volunteer resources to provide communications for key centres, not to "replace"
	the existing primary system.
</p>

<p>
	In an emergency, primary communications systems for agencies such as police
	and fire will be operating at peak capacity. The secondary communications
	infrastructure established by the radio group will relieve primary agencies from
	message traffic which is not related to their respective functions. For example,
	if phones are out at a shelter, it is not efficient to post a first responder at
	the shelter just to provide communications to get blankets, water etc.
</p>

<p>
	The two main roles of members are:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		To transmit messages which have been given to them by responsible site managers or personnel.
	</li>
	<li>
		To work with or shadow field personnel to provide radio communications back to a central area.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	In an emergency there may not be enough people to fill all the positions
	required, so the volunteer radio group member in the field may be asked by their
	Leader or their delegate if they would take on roles in addition to providing
	communications. For example, if communications is required for an evacuation
	centre and there is a shortage of Red Cross volunteers, the radio operator may
	be asked if they would assist with the Red Cross activities. These arrangements
	are made on a case by case basis.
</p>

<h2>Important Considerations for Volunteer Radio Groups</h2>

<h3>Critical Time First 24 To 48 Hours</h3>

<p>
	In a disaster, commercial solutions will be expanded or temporary ones will be deployed within
	24 to 48 hours, taking over many communications support roles. Amateur radio
	volunteers need to deploy quickly and effectively when called to maximize their
	contribution in the critical initial period of a disaster. Rapid deployment
	requires pre planning, training and equipment.
</p>

<h3>Relationships</h3>

<p>
	Building and maintaining relationships with
	the agencies served is as important for amateur radio as planning and training.
	Effective use of volunteer radio groups in an emergency will only occur if the
	agencies served know and trust the Amateur group and they understand their own
	limitations and the capabilities brought by the volunteers.
</p>

<h3>Clarity and Coverage</h3>

<p>
	People expect crystal clear wireless
	communications from anywhere. Commercial systems such as cell phones and trunked
	radio usually provide better coverage than central repeaters or base stations
	and the quality with digital systems is good or the signal fails. Amateur radio
	must pay more attention to coverage area and signal quality, to ensure that the
	best signal possible is presented. If there are coverage gaps and signal quality
	is poor, Amateur radio must work on solutions or work-a rounds where possible.
</p>

<h3>Solutions</h3>

<p>
	Volunteer radio groups need to develop and
	deliver packaged communications solutions, which solve real problems and meet or
	exceed expectations. This includes understanding what equipment is available and
	how many people are trained to use it. If the best a group can offer is no
	promises then agencies know what to expect, understanding that it is less likely
	that a group will be called.
</p>

<p>
	Claims that there are lots of amateurs with lots of equipment that do lots of
	different things, without actually verifying quantities and availability, can
	prove disastrous when called on to deliver in an emergency. Primary and support
	agencies need to know what they have available for resources and if they are
	disappointed by volunteer groups, they will look for alternate solutions in the
	future.
</p>

<h3>Volunteer Communications Options</h3>

<p>
	There are several options available for volunteer radio communications including Amateur
	Radio, Commercial Radio, Family Radio Service and Citizens Band. These solutions
	are not based on rental fees and service provider agreements. Each option has
	its benefits and drawbacks. Amateur radio is generally viewed as the most useful
	solution due to the infrastructure that exists and the general proliferation of
	equipment in the community.
</p>

<h3>Amateur Radio</h3>

<p>
	Amateur radio is a hobby dedicated to local
	and global communications, experimentation and helping others. Amateur radio
	operators, or Hams as they are often called, are licensed by the Federal
	Government and must pass a written test in order to operate their radios. As a
	solution for emergency communications, Amateur radio provides both equipment and
	people skilled in operating that equipment.
</p>

<p>
	Amateur radio brings together people and radio equipment, across multiple
	radio bands and frequencies. The local radio club or a group of amateurs usually
	operate one or more repeaters in the area to extend the range of radio coverage.
	Individual radio operators typically can provide radios, antennas, cables and a
	lot of innovation and ingenuity.
</p>

<p>
	The three mostly used radio bands are HF, VHF and UHF.
</p>


<h3>HF (High Frequency)</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		Traditional long range radio communications across the Province, Canada or the world.
	</li>

	<li>
		Used most often to support inquiries from outside the local area and
		to coordinate supplies into the local area, when phone access is poor or nonexistent.
	</li>

	<li>
		Typical installation with a tower and big beam antenna or long wire antennas.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>VHF and UHF (Very High Frequency, Ultra High Frequency)</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		Similar to traditional Police or Taxi radio systems, with hand held, mobile and base radios available
	</li>

	<li>
		Provides local coverage
	</li>

	<li>
		Range depends on antenna height and radio power
	</li>

	<li>
		Range can be extended by repeaters on hills or high buildings
	</li>

	<li>
		Used most often for communications with evacuation centres, EOC,
		Hospitals, people on foot or <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; with mobile teams in vehicles.
	</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>ARES (Amateur Radio Emergency Service)</h3>

<p>
	Many amateur radio groups working with emergency
	communications are part of a national organization called ARES. The Amateur
	Radio Emergency Service (ARES), provides a National organizational structure for
	Amateur radio groups involved in emergency communications. In Canada, ARES is
	administered by the National amateur radio group, Radio Amateurs of Canada
	(RAC).
</p>

<p>
	The National Red Cross and Radio Amateurs of Canada signed a memorandum of
	understanding in 1994. The agreement aims to promote a greater partnership
	between local Red Cross branches and their local ARES group. There is a copy of
	the agreement at
	<a href="external_url.htm?http://www.rac.ca/fieldorg/redcross.htm">http://www.rac.ca/fieldorg/redcross.htm</a>.
</p>

<p>
	There may not be an ARES group in your area, but there still may be an
	organized amateur radio group dedicated to providing emergency communications.
	In an area there may be an ARES group, or a non ARES affiliated group, but not
	both, so you can work with whichever group exists in your area. Non ARES groups
	are just as skilled and dedicated as groups that are part of ARES.
</p>

<h3>React</h3>

<p>
	REACT is a public service organization comprised of
	private radio operators serving travelers and their communities alike with radio
	communications. Member volunteers are dedicating to improving their
	communities by providing voluntary, two-way communications.
</p>

<p>
	The original REACT groups used CB radio and while most still use it, they
	also use Family Radio Service and many are also amateur radio operators. If you
	cannot find an amateur radio group, check to see if there is a REACT group in
	your area.
</p>

<h3>FRS</h3>

<p>
	Family Radio Service (FRS) is a set of 14 UHF channels
	set aside for non licensed use. Radios are available from most electronic stores
	and sell for about $50 to $100. The range is limited to about 2Km in open areas
	and would be much less in enclosed areas such as buildings.
</p>

<p>
	FRS is an option for short range communications, but there is no control of
	who uses the system, so you could find a lack of free channels or interference
	from uncaring users.
</p>

<h3>CB</h3>

<p>
	Citizen Band radio or GRS (General Radio Service) as it
	is also known, has been around for a long time. The use of CB radio has dwindled
	from its peak in the 70's to 80's, but there are still a lot of users.
</p>

<p>
	One of the problems suffered by CB radio, was the influx of "non caring"
	users. Foul language and deliberate interference caused many to exit from the
	ranks. As a communications solution, it suffers from variability in
	communications distance. However like FRS, CB radio is much better than nothing.
</p>

<h2>Finding Amateur Radio Contacts</h2>

<p>
	There is probably at least one amateur radio club in your area and there may already be a
	group of amateurs who specialize in emergency communications. If you don't know
	about amateur radio in your community, try the suggestions listed below.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Go to the Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC) web site at
		<a href="external_url.htm?http://www.rac.ca">http://www.rac.ca</a>.

		<ul>
			<li>
				Look for the link called "Emergency and disaster communications":
				<a href="external_url.htm?http://www.rac.ca/fieldorg/">http://www.rac.ca/fieldorg/</a>,
				(This will take you to the RAC Field Organization web page)
			</li>

			<li>
				Select the link "RAC ARES Emergency Coordinators"
				<a href="external_url.htm?http://www.rac.ca/fieldorg/racares.htm">http://www.rac.ca/fieldorg/racares.htm</a>
				This will provide a listing of ARES groups by Province and
				City, Town or Municipality. The list has the name and contact
				information for the Emergency Coordinator (EC) for each area that has an ARES
				group. The EC is the local contact you need.
			</li>

			<li>
				If there is no Emergency Coordinator listed for your area, look at the
				top of the listing under DEC (District Emergency Coordinator)
				for the DEC that represents your portion of the province. If there is no
				DEC listed, look for the SEC (Section Emergency Coordinator).
				The SEC represents a province. Contact the DEC or SEC and ask
				them for a local contact name.
			</li>
		</ul>

	</li>

	<li>
		Talk to your local Municipal emergency planner or administrator.

		<ul>
			<li>
				The Municipality may already work with a local amateur radio group.
			</li>
		</ul>

	</li>

	<li>
		Talk to the local Red Cross Branch

		<ul>
			<li>
				The Red Cross may already work with a local amateur radio group.
			</li>

			<li>
				Red Cross volunteers may also be radio amateurs, or know a local amateur.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		Try an Internet search with the name of your area (Town, City,
		Municipality or Region) and add the words amateur radio,
		or ARES. You may find information about a local amateur radio club.
	</li>

	<li>
		Many commercial radio technicians are also amateurs. Try
		looking in the yellow pages under "Radio communication". Call the radio shops
		listed, explain who you are and that you are trying to find a local
		ham radio operator. This person may know who to contact in your area.
	</li>

	<li>
		Try an add in the local newspaper. Explain who you are and what you are looking for.
	</li>

</ol>


<h2>Supporting Your Local Volunteer Radio Group</h2>

<p>
	Developing and maintaining an effective
	volunteer radio group requires a strong partnership between the radio group and
	the agencies or organizations they serve. There are some simple things which can
	help make life a lot easier for everyone.
</p>

<p>
	The volunteer radio groups must be accountable for their ongoing
	organization, planning, training etc. However your organization or agency can
	help that process. Have regular update meetings to find out how the volunteer
	radio group is doing and to explain what is happening in your organization. Be a
	mentor to the radio group leader if they lack some of the leadership skills.
	They must do the work, but having someone experienced to talk to is a great way
	to learn. Set dates for completion of tasks for both sides. These might be
	re-negotiated at the next meeting if required, but it makes people more
	accountable to get things done.
</p>

<h3>How To Help Your Volunteer Radio Group</h3>

<h4>ID Cards</h4>

<p>
	Volunteer radio groups can create their own ID cards, but if they are not
	recognized by local authorities, there will be delays in an emergency. Providing
	a custom ID for your agency or organization, can provide unique identification
	of radio group members, on a background that is recognized by the members of
	your organization. For example, a standard City ID card can have the name of the
	volunteer radio group added along with the word VOLUNTEER.
</p>

<h4>Meeting Space</h4>

<p>
	Most volunteer radio groups need a place to meet.
	This can be a training session, exercise or general meeting. In many areas,
	meeting space is at a premium and there is a cost associated with it. Agencies
	or organizations can provide meeting space as a means of helping the volunteer
	radio group. This has an added benefit of showing the volunteers that your
	agency or organization is truly interested and involved with the well being of
	the radio group.
</p>

<h4>Newsletters</h4>

<p>
	Volunteer groups need to stay in touch. Phones and
	e-mail can provide some of that, but there is still a need to send out paper
	copies of some information, such as updated membership lists and newsletters
	(not everyone has e-mail). Providing the radio group with a set number of
	newsletter mailings per year, helps them function as an organization.
</p>

<h4>Radio Operating Space</h4>

<p>
	In order to be integrated and effective,
	volunteer radio operators need to be part of the overall emergency operation.
	Key locations such as an EOC or major centres like the Red Cross, must have
	permanent radio installations which are collocated with all other agency
	operators. If the volunteer radio operator is out of site, they they are also
	out of the minds of everyone else.
</p>

<h4>Exercises</h4>

<p>
	Radio volunteers are taking their time to prepare for an
	event that may never happen. It is much like waiting for an opportunity to use
	your house fire insurance. Incorporating radio volunteers in larger exercises
	helps in many ways;
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Volunteer radio operators learn more about what is
		expected, where they might operate and how other agencies operate.
	</li>

	<li>
		2) Other agencies see the volunteer radio operators and begin to understand that the
		radio group is part of the big picture.
	</li>

	<li>
		3) Volunteers like to be part of
		something real. Exercises with real agencies is a lot more interesting.
	</li>
</ol>


<h4>Insurance</h4>

<p>
	Many volunteer radio groups are not
	incorporated and are not part of an organization that is, so there is no
	insurance for volunteers or their radio equipment. This makes the individual
	volunteer responsible to ensure they have adequate personal coverage for
	themselves and their equipment. Some provinces provide workers compensation for
	volunteers, but only if a state of emergency is declared.
</p>

<p>
	It is important that the topic of insurance be discussed, so the volunteers
	and the agency they work with, both understand the situation. Some
	municipalities provide some coverage for volunteers equipment if it is lost or
	damaged during an emergency.
</p>


<h3>Amateur Radio Myths</h3>

<p>
	Over the years, there has
	been a lot of confusion within the amateur radio community and within emergency
	response, regarding the role of Amateur Radio as a volunteer emergency resource.
	The confusion about the role of volunteer radio communications has created some
	volunteer groups who have distorted expectations and professional organizations
	who fear that volunteers will be more problem than good.
</p>

<p>
	The Amateur Radio Myths web page identifies a few key areas of confusion,
	which will hopefully help volunteers and professionals better understand how
	volunteer radio communications operates in an emergency.
