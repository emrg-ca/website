<br><a NAME="ROLE OF VOLUNTEER RADIO"></a><b><u><font color="#FF6600"><font size=+1>ROLE
OF VOLUNTEER RADIO GROUPS</font></font></u></b>
<br>The main role of a volunteer radio group in an emergency is to establish
a secondary communications infrastructure to;
<li>
&nbsp; Provide communications for agencies, field workers or local citizen
patrols, who do not have any radio</li>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; communication capability.
<li>
&nbsp;Link agencies, which operate on different networks such as People
Services, Hospitals &amp; the Red Cross.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Link sites, which do not normally require communications, such as
evacuation centres.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Communicate with areas that have lost normal communications networks
such as communities isolated by</li>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; loss of telephone service.
<p>In the event that primary communications systems used by Police, Fire
and Ambulance are degraded or disabled by the emergency or disaster, the
communications infrastructure provided by volunteer radio group can be
tailored to assist, depending on the specific requirements of the emergency.
It is important to understand that the volunteer radio group does not provide
full backup of the primary communications systems. There would only be
enough volunteer resources to provide communications for key centres, not
to "replace" the existing primary system.
<p>In an emergency, primary communications systems for agencies such as
police and fire will be operating at peak capacity. The secondary communications
infrastructure established by the radio group will relieve primary agencies
from message traffic which is not related to their respective functions.
For example, if phones are out at a shelter, it is not efficient to post
a first responder at the shelter just to provide communications to get
blankets, water etc.
<p>The two main roles of members are:
<br>1. To transmit messages which have been given to them by responsible
site managers or personnel.
<br>2. To work with or shadow field personnel to provide radio communications
back to a central area.
<p>In an emergency there may not be enough people to fill all the positions
required, so the volunteer radio group member in the field may be asked
by their Leader or their delegate if they would take on roles in addition
to providing communications. For example, if communications is required
for an evacuation centre and there is a shortage of Red Cross volunteers,
the radio operator may be asked if they would assist with the Red Cross
activities. These arrangements are made on a case by case basis.

<br><a NAME="Important Considerations"></a><b><u><font color="#FF6600"><font size=+1>IMPORTANT
CONSIDERATIONS FOR VOLUNTEER RADIO GROUPS</font></font></u></b>
<p><b><u>Critical Time First 24 To 48 Hours</u></b>
<br>In a disaster, commercial solutions will be expanded or temporary ones
will be deployed within 24 to 48 hours, taking over many communications
support roles. Amateur radio volunteers need to deploy quickly and effectively
when called to maximize their contribution in the critical initial period
of a disaster. Rapid deployment requires pre planning, training and equipment.
<p><b><u>Relationships</u></b>
<br>Building and maintaining relationships with the agencies served is
as important for amateur radio as planning and training. Effective use
of volunteer radio groups in an emergency will only occur if the agencies
served know and trust the Amateur group and they understand their own limitations
and the capabilities brought by the volunteers.
<p><b><u>Clarity &amp; Coverage</u></b>
<br>People expect crystal clear wireless communications from anywhere.
Commercial systems such as cell phones and trunked radio usually provide
better coverage than central repeaters or base stations and the quality
with digital systems is good or the signal fails. Amateur radio must pay
more attention to coverage area and signal quality, to ensure that the
best signal possible is presented. If there are coverage gaps and signal
quality is poor, Amateur radio must work on solutions or work arounds where
possible.
<p><b><u>Solutions</u></b>
<br>Volunteer radio groups need to develop and deliver packaged communications
solutions, which solve real problems and meet or exceed expectations. This
includes understanding what equipment is available and how many people
are trained to use it. If the best a group can offer is no promises then
agencies know what to expect, understanding that it is less likely that
a group will be called.
<p>Claims that there are lots of amateurs with lots of equipment that do
lots of different things, without actually verifying quantities and availability,
can prove disastrous when called on to deliver in an emergency. Primary
and support agencies need to know what they have available for resources
and if they are disappointed by volunteer groups, they will look for alternate
solutions in the future.

<br><a NAME="Volunteer Communications"></a><b><u><font color="#FF6600"><font size=+1>VOLUNTEER
COMMUNICATIONS OPTIONS</font></font></u></b>
<br>There are several options available for volunteer radio communications
including Amateur Radio, Commercial Radio, Family Radio Service and Citizens
Band. These solutions are not based on rental fees and service provider
agreements. Each option has its benefits and drawbacks. Amateur radio is
generally viewed as the most useful solution due to the infrastructure
that exists and the general proliferation of equipment in the community.
<p><b><u>Amateur Radio</u></b>
<br>Amateur radio is a hobby dedicated to local and global communications,
experimentation and helping others. Amateur radio operators, or Hams as
they are often called, are licensed by the Federal Government and must
pass a written test in order to operate their radios. As a solution for
emergency communications, Amateur radio provides both equipment and people
skilled in operating that equipment.
<p>Amateur radio brings together people and radio equipment, across multiple
radio bands and frequencies. The local radio club or a group of amateurs
usually operate one or more repeaters in the area to extend the range of
radio coverage. Individual radio operators typically can provide radios,
antennas, cables and a lot of innovation and ingenuity.
<p>The three mostly used radio bands are HF, VHF and UHF.
<p><u>HF (High Frequency):</u>
<li>
&nbsp;Traditional long range radio communications across the Province,
Canada or the world.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Used most often to support inquiries from outside the local area
and to coordinate supplies</li>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; into the local area, when phone access is poor or nonexistent.
<li>
&nbsp;Typical installation with a tower and big beam antenna or long wire
antennas.</li>

<p><br><u>VHF &amp; UHF (Very High Frequency, Ultra High Frequency):</u>
<li>
&nbsp;Similar to traditional Police or Taxi radio systems, with hand held,
mobile and base radios available</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Provides local coverage</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Range depends on antenna height and radio power</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Range can be extended by repeaters on hills or high buildings</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Used most often for communications with evacuation centres, EOC,
Hospitals, people on foot or</li>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; with mobile teams in vehicles.
<p>More information on Amateur radio is available on the internet at the
following location:
<br>"Beginners and New Hams"&nbsp; <a href="http://www.rac.ca/begin.htm">http://www.rac.ca/begin.htm</a>
<p><b><u>ARES</u></b>
<br>Many amateur radio groups working with emergency communications are
part of a national organization called ARES. The Amateur Radio Emergency
Service (ARES), provides a National organizational structure for Amateur
radio groups involved in emergency communications. In Canada, ARES is administered
by the National amateur radio group, Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC).
<p>The National Red Cross and Radio Amateurs of Canada signed a memorandum
of understanding in 1994. The agreement aims to promote a greater partnership
between local Red Cross branches and their local ARES group. There is a
copy of the agreement at <a href="http://www.rac.ca/redcross.htm">http://www.rac.ca/redcross.htm</a>.
<p>There may not be an ARES group in your area, but there still may be
an organized amateur radio group dedicated to providing emergency communications.
In an area there may be an ARES group, or a non ARES affiliated group,
but not both, so you can work with whichever group exists in your area.
Non ARES groups are just as skilled and dedicated as groups that are part
of ARES.
<p><b><u>React</u></b>
<br>REACT is a public service organization comprised of private radio operators
serving travelers and their communities alike with radio communications.&nbsp;
Member volunteers are dedicating to improving their communities by providing
voluntary, two-way communications.
<p>The original REACT groups used CB radio and while most still use it,
they also use Family Radio Service and many are also amateur radio operators.
If you cannot find an amateur radio group, check to see if there is a REACT
group in your area.
<p><b><u>FRS</u></b>
<br>Family Radio Service (FRS) is a set of 14 UHF channels set aside for
non licensed use. Radios are available from most electronic stores and
sell for about $50 to $100. The range is limited to about 2Km in open areas
and would be much less in enclosed areas such as buildings.
<p>FRS is an option for short range communications, but there is no control
of who uses the system, so you could find a lack of free channels or interference
from uncaring users.
<p><b><u>CB</u></b>
<br>Citizen Band radio or GRS (General Radio Service) as it is also known,
has been around for a long time. The use of CB radio has dwindled from
its peak in the 70's to 80's, but there are still a lot of users.
<p>One of the problems suffered by CB radio, was the influx of "non caring"
users. Foul language and deliberate interference caused many to exit from
the ranks. As a communications solution, it suffers from variability in
communications distance. However like FRS, CB radio is much better than
nothing.

<br><a NAME="FINDING AMATEUR RADIO"></a><b><u><font color="#FF6600"><font size=+1>FINDING
AMATEUR RADIO CONTACTS</font></font></u></b>
<br>There is probably at least one amateur radio club in your area and
there may already be a group of amateurs who specialize in emergency communications.
If you don't know about amateur radio in your community, try the suggestions
listed below.
<p>1) Go to the Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC) web site at <a href="www.rac.ca">www.rac.ca</a>.
<li>
&nbsp;Look for the link called "Emergency and disaster communications":
<a href="http://www.rac.ca/racfield.htm">http://www.rac.ca/racfield.htm</a>,</li>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; (This will take you to the RAC Field Organization web
page)
<li>
&nbsp;Select the link "RAC ARES Emergency Coordinators" <a href="http://www.rac.ca/racares.htm">http://www.rac.ca/racares.htm</a></li>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; This will provide a listing of ARES groups by Province
and City, Town or Municipality. The list has the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; name and contact information for the Emergency Coordinator
(EC) for each area that has an ARES group.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The EC is the local contact you need.
<li>
&nbsp;If there is no Emergency Coordinator listed for your area, look at
the top of the listing under DEC</li>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; (District Emergency Coordinator) for the DEC that represents
your portion of the province. If there is no
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; DEC listed, look for the SEC (Section Emergency Coordinator).
The SEC represents a province.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Contact the DEC or SEC and ask them for a local contact
name.
<p>2) Talk to your local Municipal emergency planner or administrator.
<li>
&nbsp;The Municipality may already work with a local amateur radio group.</li>

<p><br>3) Talk to the local Red Cross Branch
<li>
&nbsp;The Red Cross may already work with a local amateur radio group.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Red Cross volunteers may also be radio amateurs, or know a local
amateur.</li>

<p><br>4) Try an internet search with the name of your area (Town, City,
Municipality or Region)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and add the words amateur radio, or ARES. You may
find information about a local amateur radio club.
<p>5) Many commercial radio technicians are also amateurs.
<br>&nbsp; Try looking in the yellow pages under "Radiocommunication".
Call the radio shops listed, explain who
<br>&nbsp; you are and that you are trying to find a local ham radio operator.
This person may know who to contact in your area.
<p>6) Try an add in the local newspaper. Explain who you are and what you
are looking for.

<br><a NAME="SUPPORTING YOUR LOCAL VOLUNTEER RADIO"></a><b><u><font color="#FF6600"><font size=+1>SUPPORTING
YOUR LOCAL VOLUNTEER RADIO GROUP</font></font></u></b>
<br>Developing and maintaining an effective volunteer radio group requires
a strong partnership between the radio group and the agencies or organizations
they serve. There are some simple things which can help make life a lot
easier for everyone.
<p>The volunteer radio groups must be accountable for their ongoing organization,
planning, training etc. However your organization or agency can help that
process. Have regular update meetings to find out how the volunteer radio
group is doing and to explain what is happening in your organization. Be
a mentor to the radio group leader if they lack some of the leadership
skills. They must do the work, but having someone experienced to talk to
is a great way to learn. Set dates for completion of tasks for both sides.
These might be re-negotiated at the next meeting if required, but it makes
people more accountable to get things done.
<p><b><u>How To Help Your Volunteer Radio Group</u></b>
<br><u>ID Cards</u>
<br>Volunteer radio groups can create their own ID cards, but if they are
not recognized by local authorities, there will be delays in an emergency.
Providing a custom ID for your agency or organization, can provide unique
identification of radio group members, on a background that is recognized
by the members of your organization. For example, a standard City ID card
can have the name of the volunteer radio group added along with the word
VOLUNTEER.
<p><u>Meeting Space</u>
<br>Most volunteer radio groups need a place to meet. This can be a training
session, exercise or general meeting. In many areas, meeting space is at
a premium and there is a cost associated with it. Agencies or organizations
can provide meeting space as a means of helping the volunteer radio group.
This has an added benefit of showing the volunteers that your agency or
organization is truly interested and involved with the well being of the
radio group.
<p><u>Newsletters</u>
<br>Volunteer groups need to stay in touch. Phones and email can provide
some of that, but there is still a need to send out paper copies of some
information, such as updated membership lists and newsletters (not everyone
has email). Providing the radio group with a set number of newsletter mailings
per year, helps them function as an organization.
<p><u>Radio Operating Space</u>
<br>In order to be integrated and effective, volunteer radio operators
need to be part of the overall emergency operation. Key locations such
as an EOC or major centres like the Red Cross, must have permanent radio
installations which are collocated with all other agency operators. If
the volunteer radio operator is out of site, they they are also out of
the minds of everyone else.
<p><u>Exercises</u>
<br>Radio volunteers are taking their time to prepare for an event that
may never happen. It is much like waiting for an opportunity to use your
house fire insurance. Incorporating radio volunteers in larger exercises
helps in many ways;
<br>1) Volunteer radio operators learn more about what is expected, where
they might operate and how other agencies operate.
<br>2) Other agencies see the volunteer radio operators and begin to understand
that the radio group is part of the big picture.
<br>3) Volunteers like to be part of something real. Exercises with real
agencies is a lot more interesting.

<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><a NAME="INSURANCE"></a><b><u><font color="#FF6600"><font size=+1>INSURANCE</font></font></u></b>
<br>Many volunteer radio groups are not incorporated and are not part of
an organization that is, so there is no insurance for volunteers or their
radio equipment. This makes the individual volunteer responsible to ensure
they have adequate personal coverage for themselves and their equipment.
Some provinces provide workers compensation for volunteers, but only if
a state of emergency is declared.
<p>It is important that the topic of insurance be discussed, so the volunteers
and the agency they work with, both understand the situation. Some municipalities
provide some coverage for volunteers equipment if it is lost or damaged
during an emergency.

<br><a NAME="Amateur Radio Myths"></a><b><u><font color="#FF6600"><font size=+1>Amateur
Radio Myths</font></font></u></b>
<br>Over the years, there has been a lot of confusion within the amateur
radio community and within emergency response, regarding the role of Amateur
Radio as a volunteer emergency resource. The confusion about the role of
volunteer radio communications has created some volunteer groups who have
distored expectations and professional organizations who fear that volunteers
will be more problem than good.
<p>The Amateur Radio Myths web page identifies a few key areas of confusion,
which will hopefully help volunteers and professionals better understand
how volunteer radio communications operates in an emergency.&nbsp; <a href="amateurmyths.htm">Amateur
