<h1>EMRG Web Site Redesign</h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
  Web pages should:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>be easy to find in the menus (intuitive)</li>
  <li>download quickly -- even with slow dial-up Internet connections</li>
  <li>display correctly on high- and low-resolution monitors</li>
  <li>allow the size of the text to be changed</li>
  <li>print correctly on various paper sizes and page orientations</li>
  <li>be viewable in French via the Google Translator <sup>TM</sup></li>
  <li>be easy to transfer, with little or no modification, to a new Internet Service Provider (ISP)</li>
  <li>be easy to maintain by novices without the need for purchased software
      -- i.e. be updateable by a simple text editor (such as notepad) or
      free "WYSIWYG" editors (such as Mozilla Composer, Open Office, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Progress</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Most of the existing web pages have been converted from Visio to plain HTML --
      pages now download faster, display correctly, and print correctly with various user-selected font sizes</li>
  <li>Most links have been converted into "relative" links to simplify the transfer of the web site to a new ISP</li>
  <li>Directory structure has been simplified -- which unfortunately has caused some images and links to be broken</li>
  <li>Some broken images and links have been fixed</li>
  <li>Some menus have been reorganised to simplify navigation</li>
  <li>Web pages have been checked with I.E. and Mozilla web browsers</li>
</ol>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Structure of the Technical topic needs to be improved</li>
  <li>Miscellaneous topic contains a bunch of unrelated documents that don't seem to fit anywhere -- "Miscellaneous" documents need to be moved and/or new topics need to be created</li>
  <li>Contact Page -- what should it contain?</li>
  <li>"Overlapping" documents need to be reviewed and, possibly, refreshed</li>
  <li>Broken EMRG links (caused by the restructuring) need to be identified and repaired</li>
  <li>Broken Internet links need to be identified and repaired or removed</li>
  <li>Web pages need to be checked with various browsers (Netscape, Opera, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<h2>URLs</h2>

<p>
  Prototype EMRG Web Site:
  <br/>http://www.emrg.ca/next/
</p>

<p>
  Current "Official" EMRG Web Site:
  <br/><a href="http://www.emrg.ca">http://www.emrg.ca</a>
