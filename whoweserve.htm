<p>The emergency communications services of EMRG are available to the
	<a href="external_url.htm?http://www.ottawa.ca"> City of Ottawa</a>
	and EMRG is included in the Cities' official emergency plan.

	be used to provide communications for other agencies such as People Services
	and the Red Cross.
</p>

<p>The current City of Ottawa was formed on January 1, 2001, by the merger
	of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton and 11 local Municipalities.

<p>
	The Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG) is a member of the Hospital
	Disaster Planning Committee of Ottawa. The committee meets regularly to
	discuss issues related to hospital disaster planning. Members of the committee
	include hospital emergency planners, as well as representatives from all
	other key agencies such as Police, Fire, EMS, EMU, Red Cross, etc.
</p>

<p>
	EMRG's role in an emergency is to augment or provide backup communications
	for the intra-hospital radio system, which is used to connect the hospital
	disaster planning teams together and to communicate with the Emergency
	Measures Unit and EMS.

<h2><a name="OttawaAirport"></a>Ottawa International Airport</h2>

<p>
	The <a href="external_url.htm?http://www.ottawa-airport.ca/">Ottawa International Airport</a>
	is controlled by the MacDonald-Cartier International Airport Authority.
	In a major Airport emergency or disaster, the Emergency Measures Radio Group (EMRG)
	would typically provide communications for organizations supporting the relief
	effort in the community, not radio operators at the airport. Volunteer
	radio operators would deploy to support the City of Ottawa People Services
	and the Ottawa Red Cross with shelters, backup for the Hospitals if required
	or as additional support for logistics such as food services for agencies
	at the Airport.
